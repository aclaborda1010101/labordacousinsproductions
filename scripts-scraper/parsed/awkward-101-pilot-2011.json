MATTY Your boobs are amazing. Like music to her ears, Jenna is swept away, figuratively and literally as Matty pulls her onto a bed of dusty rags. DISSOLVE TO: Jenna and Matty laying on each other, making out as they clumsily shift their positions.   Something’s not getting in...not working... painful. JENNA (V.O) I know what you’re thinking and no, this wasn’t the inciting incident of some sappy “Tyra” special about how I got knocked up on the last day of summer camp.   I knew better than to bareback. They shift again, it’s in.   Matty starts pumping with reckless abandon as Jenna braces herself stoically, holding onto the dusty rags beneath her with a death grip. JENNA (V.O) Our passionate, bumping of uglies was a sign.   This year would be my year.   For once I wouldn’t be overlooked or invisible.   Not with Matty at my... JENNA Back door! MATTY Sorry.   It slipped. He adjusts. MATTY (stoked) Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh... FREEZE ON Matty in ecstasy and Jenna smiling through gritted teeth as a TEAR of repressed agony rolls down her cheek.  2.",

He sweetly brushes away the hair in her face. MATTY Am I hurting you? ANGLE ON Jenna.   Her tightly locked eyes cannot stop the waterworks that are now streaming down her cheeks.   She opens her pained eye-lock and nonchalantly feigns a smile. JENNA All good. MATTY But you’re crying. Jenna touches her face and wipes away the tears. JENNA Um, it’s probably just an allergy attack.   I get ‘em all the time. Don’t let it stop you. With that, Matty doesn’t hesitate to push forward. JENNA (V.O.) It was a lie.   My lady business was on fire but somehow admitting my virgin status seemed like a buzz kill. Three more pumps and Matty comes to Jesus. MATTY Awe-some. He rolls off of Jenna who looks more than a little relieved. Immediately, he pulls up his shorts and Jenna takes the cue to put herself together. With teen post-coital awkwardness, they quietly smooth out their matching “Counselor” t-shirts looking anywhere but at each other. JENNA So... MATTY Are you bummed that summer’s over?  3. JENNA Yeah. MATTY Any plans for your last two weeks? JENNA I dunno.   Probably just hang out. Watch movies.   Swim or something. MATTY Cool. JENNA You going to sophomore orientation? MATTY Don’t we have to? JENNA Yeah, right, of course.   What I meant was... JENNA (V.O.) I couldn’t help myself.   Matty had cracked my hard candy shell and I was oozing with sticky sweet love. JENNA ...do you wanna go...together? Matty gives her a sweet kiss then cups her exuberant face. MATTY You’re the shit, J-town... JENNA (V.O) So he wasn’t a poet.   He was still Matty McKibben. MATTY ...but no one can know that I like you. HOLD ON her horrified and wounded expression. JENNA (V.O) And I was still Jenna Hamilton. SMASH CUT TO: “THAT GIRL”  4. ACT ONE INT.

Jenna’s “Friends” bank is compiled with only 11 friends. She types in “Matty McKibben” taking us to his page where we notice Jenna’s Awaiting Friend Confirmation. Jenna closes it out and pulls up her online blog “Invisible Girl Daily”.   Her online diary. Thinking out loud: JENNA What do I call the worst day of my life? She looks down at her red and raw inner thighs peeking out from under her shorts.   She types as she answers her own question: JENNA (V.O.) Rubbed Raw and Reeling. Suddenly an IM pops up from “SexieT”:   “Calling you! ” Jenna’s cell phone RINGS.   She picks up. INTERCUT WITH: INT. TAMARA’S ROOM- SAME TAMARA (15, cherubic, boy-crazy, smarter than she thinks, not as beautiful as she acts) sits on her bed snacking on crackers while talking into the phone. TAMARA Okay, don’t tell me, let me see if I can guess.   I had this psychic moment today when my mom couldn’t find her purse.   It was so freaky, I just knew it was in the car. JENNA Have at it, gypsy.   What do you see? TAMARA (concentrating) Okay, so I’m sensing that Matty took you to the closet and...um, nada.   I got nothing.  6.",

TAMARA It wasn’t like I saw it psychically or anything.   It’s just that guys like Matty, don’t go for girls like us.   At least not until college when the playing field is leveled and our fourth grade indiscretions are erased. JENNA I peed my pants during an earthquake.   I was nine!   That’s not an indiscretion.   And bringing that up isn’t making me feel any better. TAMARA I’m sorry.   Look at the bright side, Matty didn’t finger you, broadcast it to the entire band and then ditch you at the winter formal to hook up with “Scary Kerry”. That was hard core humiliation.   In your scenario, at least nothing happened. JENNA Yeah, at least nothing happened. Jenna crosses her legs, cringing. TAMARA I mean, can you even imagine how suicidal you’d be if, god forbid, you actually took your shirt off? JENNA I can only imagine. TAMARA Jen, I sense some major depressed action on your end and you gotta snap out of it.  7.  (MORE) Marching band’s having a kegger at Ricky Schwartz’ house tonight.   I need my favorite wing woman there since Keiko’s bagged out. JENNA Is she grounded again? TAMARA Yeah, she can’t get her PSAT scores above ten seventy.   Her parents are starting to think she might not be Japanese. JENNA That’s not cool. TAMARA I didn’t say it.   Keiko did.   So, will you come? JENNA I’ll think about it.   Call you later? TAMARA I’ll keep my phone up close and personal in anticipation.   It’s on vibrate. JENNA I just puked a little. TAMARA That’s my girl.   Now go sob in your blog.   And feel free to quote me. JENNA Thanks, mom.   I’m hanging up now. END INTERCUT: Jenna hangs up and inches off her bed dropping the unopened LETTER on the floor.   She looks at the mysteriously typed envelope- no return address- and takes it to the bathroom. INT. BATHROOM- SAME Jenna runs a bath then she sits on the edge of her tub.

She gonna try to do something to her hair.   As she attempts to tame her mane, she sizes up a big Costco-sized bottle of aspirin in her medicine cabinet. JENNA Costco, take me away. She puts down the blowdryer- still on- and she throws back two pills without water then...starts choking, the pills are lodged in her throat. Immediately, she drops the bottle of pills, spilling them on the floor. In her attempt to cough up the pills, she slips on them causing her to flail backwards, twisting her arm and knocking her head on the side of the bathtub which launches the pills out of her mouth while also simultaneously knocking the blow dryer and a set of razors into the bathtub. Suddenly, the circuit breakers shut off.   All the lights in the house go dark.   Silence. ANGLE ON the crazy bathroom and an unconscious Jenna in the middle of the floor of pills as the blow dryer and razors float on the surface of the water.... Off camera we hear Jenna’s mom running upstairs: LACEY (O.C.) Jenna?...Jenna?...JENNA!!!

DOCTOR Physically, she’s on the road to recovery but emotionally, it’s going to be a long haul. LACEY Why can’t she just be like every other teenager and just starve herself?   I can wrap my head around that.   But this? KEVIN Lacey, this isn’t about you.   Our daughter is suicidal. WHIP PAN TO JENNA- her eyes now wide open. JENNA (V.O.) I wasn’t suicidal! DOCTOR Did she exhibit any warning signs? KEVIN She’s always been a shy kid.   I didn’t really think there was anything to worry about... JENNA (V.O.) Dad to the rescue.   He had my back. KEVIN ...until I found the note on her computer. SMASH CUT TO:  Sometimes being a teenager makes you want to die.  BACK TO: JENNA (V.O.) To clarify, it was just a dramatic teenage rant.   Not a cry for help. LACEY She spends a lot of time alone on her computer.   Is that a sign?  11. Jenna MOANS, constricted by her bandages. KEVIN Hey, sweetheart. She MOANS again.   Lacey shushes her with her finger against Jenna’s lips as they wrap themselves around her. LACEY It’s okay, honey. Rest. Everything’s going to be okay. You’re going to be okay. As her parents coddle her, Jenna’s eyes go wide with panic. JENNA   (V.O.) This was a misunderstanding of epic proportions.   God, I wanted to die. I mean...you know what I mean. END OF ACT ONE  12.

Sooo nice to meet you! And I love your outfit. JENNA Only took thirty minutes to put on. Valerie laughs. VALERIE You go, girl! Jenna’s awkward expression says it all: weird. VALERIE So, I know that Mr. Michaels was your guidance counselor last year but considering your recent... JENNA Accident. VALERIE Yes, considering your recent accident, Mr. Michaels thought we might be better fit.   Ya know, girl on girl.   I mean, girl to girl. Sometimes it’s easier to express yourself to your own kind. JENNA (V.O.) I’m not sure what she was insinuating but she was definitely crossing lines. VALERIE Your mom gave me a copy of the letter that you got in the mail. It wasn’t very nice. JENNA Carefrontations never are. VALERIE That’s a nifty turn of phrase.

I think you’ve covered everything. Jenna gets up and is out the door when her cell phone BEEPS. She looks down and opens a TEXT reading:  You’re gonna kill this year!  Another text BEEPS.  Just not yourself! - Valerie  Jenna slowly looks through Valerie’s door window....Valerie’s staring at her with a crazy smile.   Jenna awkwardly smiles back then trudges on with a SIGH. CUT TO: EXT. QUAD- DAY It’s lunch time. Students mill about on a grassy quad chatting, flirting and eating their mid-day meals. ANGLE ON Jenna trying to sit comfortably on the grass but falling to the side with no back support.   Keiko finally helps her lean up against a nasty TRASH CAN.   Tamara stands over them with a look of disgust. TAMARA She cannot sit against that. KEIKO You have a better option? They look around.   There’s no better option.  21.  VALERIE (CONT'D) JENNA Gravity sucks. I’ll take what I can get. Keiko spreads out a napkin and wedges it between Jenna’s back and the trash can, adjusting Jenna just right. KEIKO (laughing) I wish you could see yourself. JENNA Really?   Cuz I don’t. Jenna spots Matty in the crowd. He’s hanging with a GROUP OF CHEERLEADERS.   It’s hard to watch. As she looks away, she notices the not-so-subtle stares of students directed at her. JENNA (at wits end) What is the fascination with me?! KEIKO You had a dance with death.   Like a bad car crash on the side of the road.   Everyone wants a peek. JENNA Next person who stares is gonna get the evil eye. TAMARA An evil eye, in your condition, is not gonna translate.
