The rear wheels spin air. The engine cuts off.   Silence again.   The Winnie’s door kicks open and out stumbles underpants man.   He yanks off his gas mask, lets it drop. He’s forty years old.   Receding hairline.   A bit pasty. He’s not a guy who makes a living working with his hands. He’s not a guy we’d pay attention to if we passed him on the street.   But right now, at this moment, in this pasture? Right now, we’d step the fuck out of his way. Underpants man looks at the RV.   End of the line for that. He listens hard.   Out of the silence, we hear... SIRENS. They’re faint, a few miles off -- but growing louder.   Our guy knows he’s boned with a capital B.   He HOLDS HIS BREATH and leaps back inside the RV. INT. WINNEBAGO - CONTINUOUS A chrome 9mm is clutched in the hand of one of the dead Mexicans.   Underpants grabs it, tucks it in his waistband. His unconscious passenger, still strapped in his seat, lets out a groan.   Underpants leans past him, yanks open the glove box.   He comes up with a WALLET and a tiny Sony CAMCORDER. EXT. COW PASTURE - CONTINUOUS Ducking outside, he starts breathing again.   A short sleeve DRESS SHIRT on a hanger dangles from the Winnebago’s awning. Underpants pulls it on.   He finds a clip-on tie in the pocket, snaps it to his collar.   No trousers, unfortunately. He licks his fingers, slicks his hair down with his hands. He’s looking almost pulled together now -- at least from the waist-up.   All the while, the sirens are getting LOUDER. Underpants figures out how to turn on the camcorder.   He twists the little screen around so he can see himself in it. Framing himself waist-up, he takes a moment to gather his thoughts... then presses RECORD.  2 .",

To all law enforcement entities, this is not an admission of guilt.   I’m speaking now to my family. (swallows hard) Skyler... you are... the love of my life.   I hope you know that. Walter Junior.   You’re my big man. I should have told you things, both of you.   I should have said things. But I love you both so much.   And our unborn child.   And I just want you to know that these... things you’re going to learn about me in the coming days.   These things. I just want you to know that... no matter what it may look like... I had all three of you in my heart. The sirens are WAILING now, on top of us.   WALTER WHITE, the underpants man, turns off the camcorder.   He carefully sets it on a bare patch of ground by his feet.   Next to it he sets his wallet, lying open where it can be seen. CLOSE ON the wallet -- a photo ID card is visible.   Walt’s smiling face is on it.   It identifies him as a teacher at J.P. Wynne High School, Ontario Unified School District. Walt pulls the chrome pistol from the back of his waistband, aiming it across the tall weeds.   It glints hard in the sun. Flashing red LIGHT BARS speed into view, skimming the tops of the weeds.   Heading straight for us. Walt stands tall in his underpants, not flinching.   Off him, ready to shoot the first cop he sees... END TEASER  3 . ACT ONE EXT. WHITE HOUSE - NIGHT No president ever slept here.   No millionaire ever visited. This is a three-bedroom RANCHER in a modest neighborhood. Weekend trips to Home Depot keep it looking tidy, but it’ll never make the cover of “Architectural Digest.” We’re in Ontario, California -- the Inland Empire.   LEGEND: “ONE MONTH EARLIER.” INT.

He and Skyler eat their breakfast in silence. Skyler glances up, sees Walt puzzling over his bacon. SKYLER Sizzle-Lean.   We need to think about our cholesterol. WALT Huh. Skyler’s cute in a way most guys wouldn’t have noticed back in high school.   But not soft-cute.   Not in the eyes. She’s dressed for staying home -- she’s five months pregnant and just beginning to show. SKYLER When’ll you be home? WALT Same time. SKYLER I don’t want him dicking you around tonight.   You get paid till six, you work till six.   Not seven. Seventeen year-old WALTER, JR. enters the kitchen, dressed for school, hair still damp from the shower.   The CLICK... CLICK of his forearm crutches precedes him into the room. Walt and Skyler’s son is a sweet-faced teenager who appears to have cerebral palsy.   He moves slowly and awkwardly, and grinds his teeth as he labors to talk.   But he’s a smart kid. WALT Hey. Just seating himself at the table is a trial for Walter, Jr. His parents don’t give him the slightest help.   They treat him as if he were able-bodied, which is how he wants it. SKYLER You’re late. He shrugs.   She gets up, serves him breakfast.   Walter, Jr. squints at the plate she plops down before him.  5 .",

WALTER, JR. What’s this--even--made of?! He looks to his dad for backup.   Walt shrugs, ambivalent. WALT Eat it. EXT. HIGH SCHOOL - MORNING J.P. Wynne High School.   Home of the Fightin’ Skyhawks.   Two thousand-plus students, many of them in overflow trailers. Into the faculty lot motors a 1991 Nissan wagon.   It was a piece of shit when it rolled off the assembly line, and has not improved with age.   It parks in a handicapped space. A handicapped placard hangs from the rear-view. Walt climbs out from behind the wheel, checks his watch. He’s late.   Walter, Jr. struggles to get out of the passenger side.   He fumbles with his crutches and his backpack. WALT All set? (off his son’s nod) Alright, see you at home. Walt grabs his briefcase and hurries toward the building, leaving his son to work it out for himself -- which is, again, exactly how Walter, Jr. wants it. INT. HIGH SCHOOL - CLASSROOM - DAY Hours later.   This is a chemistry classroom -- black-topped lab tables with gas spigots.   Walt is lecturing to seniors.  6 . WALT Chemistry is the study of what? STUDENT (a beat) Chemicals. Snickers from the smart kids.   Walt smiles. WALT Chemicals.   No.   Change.   Chemistry is the study of change. (a beat) Think about it.   Electrons change their orbits, molecules change their bonds.   Elements combine and change into compounds.   That’s all of life, right?   The constant... (shrug) The cycle.   Solution, dissolution, over and over. Walt seems to be talking mostly to himself.   A pep talk. WALT Growth, decay.   Transformation. It’s fascinating, really. Handsome, blonde CHAD sits slouched in the back with his hand jammed in the lap of his cheerleader GIRLFRIEND.   He whispers to her and she giggles.   Walt snaps out of it.

Walt sips his coffee and stares into space. At the nearest table, a CHINESE GUY sits with two CHINESE GIRLS.   They’re laughing and talking in CANTONESE.   They keep their voices low so their gossip might not be overheard -- but it’s not like we have any idea what they’re saying. Walt takes another sip of coffee, carefully sets down the cup.   He looks at his hand for a long moment. He notices his fingers are TREMBLING slightly.   He makes a fist, squeezes it tight.   Opens it. The Asian students are talking a mile-a-minute, the two girls giggling.   Walt glances at them, looks back to his hand.   He presses it flat against the tabletop. UP-ANGLE -- as seen through this GLASS TOP TABLE, Walt’s fingers stick to the surface.   They pull loose with a slow, gluey SLURP. CLOSER on Walt.   He rubs his mouth, sneaks his fingertips to his carotid artery just under his ear.   He’s feeling his pulse.   The furtive whispering in CHINESE fills his head. He’s starting to breathe faster. His cellphone RINGS.   He glances at the readout screen. “HOME,” it says.   Walt silences it, tucks the phone back in his pocket. Rapid-fire CHINESE is all we hear.   Now it gets drowned out by a sudden WHOOSH that makes Walt blink.   It’s the whoosh of the nearby cappuccino machine.   It’s unnaturally loud, like a jet engine.   Walt’s had enough.   Time to go. HIGH ANGLE - DOWN THROUGH THE TREES Magnolia leaves sway in f.g.   We’re looking down at Walt, tiny in the distance, as he rises to his feet.   He makes it three steps before he COLLAPSES, flipping an empty table. Students look up, hesitate.   The Chinese guy and a couple of others rise to help.   Off Walt, lying on his face...

Absently tapping the table.   He’s been here for hours. Muffled RINGING.   Walt reaches for his pants, fishes out his cellphone.   “HOME” is yet again displayed on the readout. Walt considers, answers it. WALT Hey. (a beat) Yeah, sorry.   I had it turned off. I was, uh... (a beat) Yeah, probably about an hour or so. Amid the bustle out in the hall, two ER DOCTORS stand conferring.   They’re looking at blood chemistry results -- first one man studies them, then the other.   When one of them glances back our way, we realize they’re talking about Walt. Walt sees this.   He can’t hear what they’re saying, but it looks weighty.   Walt is anxious.   However, he doesn’t let it come through in his voice. WALT I’m at Caltech.   I ran into an old professor, we got to talking.   I should be home in about an hour. Okay. Walt clicks off.   He looks again to the doctors in the hall. One man nods to the other, walks off.   The remaining doctor puts on his bedside smile and enters Walt’s room. DOCTOR Sorry for the wait.   You can put your clothes back on. Walt climbs off the table, steps into his pants. WALT I’ve had it before.   Low blood sugar.   Stood up too fast. He’s fishing.   The doctor doesn’t saying anything, just fills out a form.   Walt pulls on his shirt, buttons it.  18 . WALT Guess I should’ve had breakfast this morning. DOCTOR There’s a specialist I’d like you to see.   His name is Dr. Belknap. I should have his... card here somewhere.   Yes. The doctor finds a business card, hands it to Walt.   Walt stands in his socks, staring at the card for a long beat. WALT Oncologist... DOCTOR (forced breezy) It’s probably absolutely nothing. INT. DR. BELKNAP’S OFFICE/EXAM AREA - DAY Days later.

I sent it to you on the third.   It’s number... wait a minute, let me get my checkbook. She cups a hand over the phone, does nothing.   After a beat: SKYLER (into phone) Here it is.   It’s check number 1148.   So my records show I paid that, and I certainly don’t feel like we owe any late... (listens) Alright.   I guess then I’ll check with my bank and, I don’t know, if the post office lost it or something... alright then.   Let me look into that.   Thank you. Walt enters, hearing the tail-end.   Skyler hangs up. SKYLER You’re home early. Walt nods, finds a beer in the fridge.   His fingers tremble a little as he pries off the cap.   Skyler doesn’t notice -- she’s sifting through a stack of bills. Walt sits at the table.   He drinks deep, rubs his mouth. SKYLER How was your day? WALT You know.   Same.  21 .",

We needed printer paper. SKYLER Walt, the MasterCard’s the one we don’t use. Walt nods, overwhelmed and hiding it.   Skyler doesn’t know about his doctor’s appointment.   Even if Walt wants to tell her, something stops him.   He sips his beer, stares. Loud MACHINE GUN FIRE startles them both.   Skyler yells into the living room. SKYLER DAMMIT, WALTER!   TURN THAT DOWN! (more GUNFIRE) Go talk to him. Walt rises, sets his bottle in the sink. INT. WHITE HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS The end of “Scarface” plays on the TV.   TONY MONTANA, with his mountain of cocaine and his M-16, takes on all comers. Walter, Jr. is sprawled on the couch, watching.   His crutches are leaned against the armrest. WALTER, JR. Hey. WALT Hey.

WHITE HOUSE - SPARE BEDROOM - NIGHT SQUEAK-SQUEAK, SQUEAK-SQUEAK.   Walt thumps up and down on his cheapie stair-stepper.   He speeds up -- faster than the last time.   Thump, thump, thump.   As seen through the bars of the empty crib, he’s really working it hard. Sweat beads on his face.   Bam, bam, bam.   Faster, faster. Harder.   Violent.   Sweat drips off his nose.

BLUE-COLLAR NEIGHBORHOOD - MORNING A different morning -- these things take time to set up. We’re in a neighborhood not unlike Walt’s.

You got the green light. An affirmation comes back.   Hank starts his engine. HANK (smiling, to Walt) Watch this.   This makes ‘em shit. Out of the distance, we hear a BIG ENGINE REVVING, speeding our way.   A TRUCK roars past, heading for the cul-de-sac. Hank slowly follows it in his Ford -- just so Walt can see. Hank hums   Ride Of The Valkyries , channeling “Apocalypse Now.” Walt’s POV:   as seen through the windshield, the lead truck goes speeding into the target house’s driveway.   An ENTRY TEAM of six agents jumps out, looking like they just came from the set of a sci-fi movie -- they’re covered head-to-toe in CHEMICAL SUITS and RESPIRATOR GEAR.   They carry carbines and shotguns.   One man lugs a battering ram. HANK Meth labs are nasty on a good day -- but when you mix that stuff wrong, you wind up with mustard gas.  25 .

KRAZY-8, a young, hard-looking Mexican, sits on a sofa dotted with cigarette burns.   He’s playing NBA basketball on his PS2. The front door stands open -- but the screen door, all heavy reinforced steel, is shut.   Visible through it, Dupree wanders up onto the porch, cups his eyes and peers in. DUPREE Yo, Kraze!
