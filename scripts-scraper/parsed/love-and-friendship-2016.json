SUSAN I have no reason to complain of Mr. Vernon’s reception but I’m not entirely satisfied with his lady’s. MRS. CROSS No? SUSAN She's perfectly well-bred, surprisingly so, but her manner doesn’t persuade me that she's disposed in my favour. A sympathetic look of agreement from Mrs. Cross. SUSAN (CONT’D) As you might have noticed I sought to be as amiable as possible-- MRS. CROSS Exceptionally amiable. In fact entirely charming -- excuse me for saying so-- SUSAN Not at all -- it's true.   I wanted her to be delighted with me-- (disappointed) --but I didn’t succeed. MRS. CROSS I can't understand it. Susan, thoughtful, recalls: SUSAN It’s true I have always detested her. And that, before her marriage, I went to great lengths to prevent it. Yet it shows an illiberal spirit to resent for long a plan which didn’t succeed. MRS. CROSS Decidedly illiberal. Not liberal at all! 7.",

But I’ve found that, where there’s a disposition to dislike, a pretext will soon be found. MRS. CROSS You mustn’t reproach yourself-- SUSAN I shan't -- the past is done. My project will be the children. I know a couple of their names already and have decided to attach myself to young Frederick in particular, taking him on my lap and sighing over him for his dear Uncle's sake-- A knock on the door. SUSAN (CONT’D) Come in. Wilson enters. WILSON Mrs. Vernon's compliments, your ladyship.   She asks if you and Mrs. Cross would join her for tea? SUSAN With pleasure-- She exchanges a look with Mrs. Cross. SUSAN (CONT’D) Mrs. Cross would prefer her repose but thank Mrs. Vernon -- I will join her directly. INT. GOLD ROOM -- DAY A footman crosses out while Catherine checks the tea setting; the sounds of children come from off-screen. 8. SUSAN (O.S.) Yes, Frederick, I see you have quite an appetite: you will grow tall and handsome like your uncle -- and father. LITTLE CHARLOTTE VERNON (O.S.) Frederick, be good... Catherine smiles and approaches them. LITTLE CHARLOTTE VERNON (O.S.) (CONT’D) Frederick, don’t touch that! CATHERINE Frederick, be careful. The off-screen clatter of metal objects. CATHERINE (CONT’D) I’m so sorry! From off, Susan laughs, then enters with a gash of red jam on her dress. SUSAN Not at all. Such a family resemblance -- it rather moves me. CATHERINE You’ll want to change. Susan covers the mark with a napkin and smoothly sits. SUSAN Oh no -- let’s have our tea while it’s warm. Mrs. Cross is a genius with fabrics. Catherine serves the tea.   Susan takes her cup. CATHERINE Are you sure? SUSAN Oh yes! How much Frederick reminds me of his dear uncle! CATHERINE You think there's a resemblance? SUSAN Yes, remarkable -- the eyes… 9. Catherine considers this: CATHERINE Weren’t Frederick Vernon's eyes brown? SUSAN (usi",

SUSAN --it's her husband, Mr. Vernon, who has Churchill. SIR JAMES Churchill? That's how you say it? All-together that way: (very, very quickly) “Churchill.” (marvelling) That explains a great deal. I had heard “church” ...and “hill” -- but I couldn’t find either. All I saw was a big house. (laughs) Fine name: “Churchill.” Marlborough, right? The general. He showed the French!
