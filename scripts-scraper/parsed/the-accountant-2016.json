RICE HOME BINOCULAR LENS POV -- The last canteloupe EXPLODES. A mile of farmland blurs by as the lens searches, focuses: Chris stands at the edge of the timber, gun in hand, staring at the lens.   He raises a hand “good-bye”, turns. At a window, Frank lowers binoculars from stunned eyes. DOLORES (O.S.) Wouldn’t kill you to go out and give him a few pointers, y’know. EXT.

The bed-- a homemade contraption -- atop a mechanical frame; a queen mattress curled over on itself lengthwise to form a shape not unlike a hollowed out log.   Chris tucked inside. Chris lies snug in the bed, studies a poster on the opposite wall; ADULT FACES, subtle expressions-- surprise, anger, confusion.   Joy.   Chris mimics joy, puts a hand to his mouth, feels his smile.   Lets it fade. He works a remote control and a small motor whirs, rotating the bed upward, mattress flattening.   On his back now, eyes resting on a large framed JACKSON POLLOCK mounted flush to the ceiling. He daydreams, lost in chaotic swirls of viscous paint. INT.

She couldn’t afford a gown, borrowed a blue suit that her cousin wore when she worked the cosmetic counter at Woolworths.   Blue.   But as Esther liked to say-- FRANCIS “I was worthy of white.”   CHRIS “I was worthy of white.” Francis laughs; at the memory, his repetition.   Chris smiles, pleased to have made Francis laugh. FRANCIS Boy, was she worthy.   I think it’s why our engagement was so short, my balls were a lovely shade of blue. Chris puzzled by the shade of Francis’ testicles. FRANCIS My Esther.   She’d have liked you. So very much. Chris considers this for a long beat. 19. CHRIS Why? FRANCIS Why what? CHRIS Would she have liked us? Francis recognizes the flash of depression, feels for him. FRANCIS One day you’ll see an opportunity to slide out of here.   Memorize the names I gave you?   The numbers? CHRIS Yes. FRANCIS They’ll get you started, give you work.   Try to find one person to help you, to trust.   One.   You’ll have to rely on word of mouth, your reputation, for new business. Don’t try to separate saints from sinners, we’re all sinners.   People keep secrets, numbers release them; if the secrets are too big, killing you to keep them may be the cost of doing business.

She whirls around, frightened... the Fed-Ex guy. Fed Ex holds his palms up,   whoa .   He hands her a rectangular CARDBOARD BOX, size of a flat screen TV but much lighter. She takes it, no return address. INT. DANA’S APARTMENT - NIGHT Dana sits on a love seat, reaches into the Fed-Ex box, pulls... a frame, followed by   Dogs Playing Poker . INT. DANA’S APARTMENT-BEDROOM - NIGHT Dana finishes nailing a picture hanger into the wall.   She hangs   Dogs   on the hook, straightens it. She steps back to gauge her work.   She LAUGHS, remembering. Her laughter fades, in her eyes a touch of sadness.   An imperfection catches her eye, a small bubble in an upper corner. She fingers the bubble, something beneath.   She picks at a tiny flap of paper, inspects... FREEZES.   She slowly tears the print the length of the frame. Dana shocked.   She stares at the half-revealed Pollock hanging on her wall.   Nervous, she moves to the window, grabs the shade pull, hesitates.   She looks out the window, GRINS. INT. AIRSTREAM (MOVING) - SUNSET Sun leaks through drawn shades, warms blonde wood.   The Renoir also gone. INT. SUV (MOVING) - SUNSET Windows down, radio on, Chris, T-shirt and jeans, drives. The cuts on his face fading, he gently taps his fingers to the music, daydreams. Colorado’s San Juan Mountains visible through his windshield. EXT. DURANGO, COLORADO - SUNSET The SUV trailers the Airstream down a steep grade, the picturesque town of Durango nestled at the base of the pass. The road curves, the SUV and Airstream follow the switchback behind the mountain, disappear. FADE OUT. THE END 116.",
