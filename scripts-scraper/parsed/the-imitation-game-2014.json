JOHN   CAIRNCROSS  What’s   that?  STEWART   MENZIES  Burn   everything.  HUGH   ALEXANDER  What?  STEWART   MENZIES  We   told   you   when   you   started   that  this   was   a   top   secret   program.   Did  you   think   we   were   joking?  HUGH   ALEXANDER  But   the   war   is   over.  ALAN   TURING  This   war   is   over.   But   there   will   be  more.   And   we   know   how   to   break   a  code   that   everyone   else   thinks   is  unbreakable.  STEWART   MENZIES  (with   a   smile   at   Alan)  Alright.   Tear   it   down,   light   it   up,  sweep   away   the   ashes.   None   of   you  have   ever   met   before.   None   of   you  have   ever   even   heard   the   word  Enigma.   Have   a   safe   trip   home.  109.  (MORE)",

MANCHESTER   POLICE   STATION   -   INTERROGATION   ROOM   -   1951  Alan   Turing   finishes   telling   his   story   to   Detective   Nock.  DETECTIVE   NOCK  That’s...   Unbelievable.  ALAN   TURING  That’s   the   Imitation   Game.  DETECTIVE   NOCK  I   don’t   know   what   to   do   now.  ALAN   TURING  Now,   Detective,   you   get   to   judge.  That’s   how   the   game   works.   I  answered   your   questions.   You   know  my   story.   That’s   the   point   of   the  game.   We   are   all   pretending   to   be  something.   Imitating   something.  Someone.   And   we   are   no   more,   and   no  less,   than   what   we   can   convince  other   people   that   we   are.   So   tell  me:   What   am   I?   Am   I   a   person?   Am   I  a   machine?   Am   I   a   war   hero?   Am   I   a  criminal?  DETECTIVE   NOCK  I   can’t   judge   you.  ALAN   TURING  Well   then   you’re   no   help   to   me   at  all.  ON   ALAN:   Turning   away.   He’s   done   with   Nock.  CUT   TO:  INT.

He   makes   his   way   to   —  —   Detective   Nock’s   desk.  110.  STEWART MENZIES (CONT'D) PLAINCLOTHES   OFFICER  Congratulations,   Sir.  The   Officer   drops   the   newspaper   in   front   of   Nock.  The   headline   reads:   “CAMBRIDGE   PROFESSOR   SENTENCED   FOR  INDECENCY”,   above   a   photo   of   Alan.  ON   NOCK:   This   should   make   him   happy.   But   instead   he   feels  only   empty   and   sick.  INT.   ALAN   TURING’S   HOUSE   -   DAY  We   find   Alan   in   his   study.   He’s   gained   weight   since   last   we  saw   him   —   he’s   grown   paler   as   well.   Haggard.   And   ",

ALAN   TURING’S   HOUSE   -   DAY   -   1954  A   familiar   scene:   A   HALF-DOZEN   POLICE   OFFICERS   swarm   the  Manchester   home   of   (former)   mathematics   professor   Alan  Turing.  Detective   Nock   passes   the   double-parked   police   cars   and  ascends   the   front   steps   of   Alan’s   house.  Remembers   the   first   time   he   was   here.  INT.   ALAN   TURING’S   HOUSE   -   CONTINUOUS  A   CONSTABLE   leads   Detective   Nock   upstairs,   gesturing   into   the  open   BEDROOM   door.  In the doorway, we see a team of COPS tending to something on  the bed. There’s an APPLE on the nightstand.  CONSTABLE  Suicide,   looks   like.   Half-eaten  apple   next   to   the   bed.   Some   sort   of  white   powder   all   over   it.  DETECTIVE   NOCK  Cyanide.  (off the Constable’s look)  You’ll   find   a   tub   of   it   downstairs.  The   Constable   makes   a   curious   face:   How   can   you   know   that?  Nock   approaches   the   bed,   and   stares   into   the   lifeless   face   of  Alan   Turing.  ON   NOCK:   Alan   Turing   made   the   world   a   better   place...   And  Nock   killed   him   for   it.  CUT   TO:  EXT.   BLETCHLEY   PARK   -   NIGHT   -   1945  Alan,   Joan,   Hugh,   John,   and   Peter   stand   before   the   MASSIVE  BONFIRE   that’s   been   built   in   the   center   of   the   Park.  TITLE:   Alan   Turing   committed   suicide   in   1954.  TITLE:   His   machine   was   never   perfected,   though   it  generated   a   whole   field   of   research   into   what   became  nicknamed   “Turing   Machines.”   Today,   we   call   them   “computers.”  Hugh   comes   over   and   puts   one   arm   around   Alan,   another   around  Joan.   They   have   a   moment:   They   did   it.   They   won   the   war.  John   throws   a   stack   of   Enigma   messages   high   into   the   air   —  116.",
