Riggan sees Mike Shiner (39) coming down the aisle, slovenly dressed with mussed hair and intense eyes. MIKE (CONT’D) Do you have any idea who walked these boards before you? (Beat.) Geraldine Page, Marlon Brando, Helen Hayes, Jason Robards... And now you. Riggan Thomson. Riggan, trying to hide the intimidation. RIGGAN Thanks for coming on such short notice, Mike.

A strong, artificial wind blows through Laura’s hair. Desolate music. LAURA (To the audience as soliloquy.) In the days before Nick’s depression really started to eat away at him, he had no idea I was pregnant. And I never intended on telling him.

He opens the window and feels the sun and the breeze on his swollen face. We just hear the sounds of the people standing down in the parking lot. Media trucks. Fans. We stay with Riggan, who seems to be thinking about something. He sees a flock of birds dancing in the sky. Then he grabs the side of the window with one hand and begins to step up onto the sill. The camera pans away from him to a table that has some photos propped on it: One of he and Sam when she was a child. One with Sylvia and Sam. A copy of Carver’s “What we talk About When We Talk About Love” laying on the surface. The camera continues to pan until it comes to the door. Sam enters with a small vase. She looks around... SAM Dad? She goes to the bathroom and peers in... nothing. SAM (CONT’D) Dad...? She spots the opened window and registers the sounds from outside. Tentatively she walks toward the window. She gets there, summons her courage and looks down. Nothing. Slowly, confused, she tilts her head up and looks up into the sky. A smile, filled with pride, begin to wash over her face.
