ON SCREEN: EASTLEIGH, NAIROBI, KENYA - 06h00  A scraping sound as the door of a small brick oven opens.  FATIMA MO’ALLIM, early 30's, slender, Somali, reaches in and  places loaves of unbaked bread into the wood-fire oven.  A worn blue headscarf - a hijab - is wrapped around her head  to cover her hair but still reveals her beautiful face.  FATIMA runs a small home bakery business within the walls of  the family compound.  The bakery opens onto a sandy courtyard that surrounds a  small rough brick home with a corrugated sheet metal roof and  a separate, small roughly constructed bicycle workshop.  There are bicycles and bits of bicycles everywhere.  FATIMA’S husband, MUSA (30's) sits on a crate amidst the  bicycles he repairs putting the finishing touches onto a home  made “hula hoop” made of black PVC tubing.  His young daughter, ALIA, 10, watches with impatient  excitement as he inserts a plastic connector into the tube to  join the two ends in a hoop.  ALIA  Is it done, Papa?!   ALIA (CONT’D)  Weli ma dhameyn miyaa Aabe?!  (Welli mah dah-main meeyah Ah-  be?!)  MUSA  Patience, Alia...   MUSA (CONT’D)  Dulgaado, Alia...  (Dul-gaar-doh, Alia...)

FATIMA looks out into the yard at her and smiles.  As ALIA continues to spin the hoop, the CAMERA RISES UP over  her and continues to rise, higher and higher, until we are  seeing:  A BIRD’S-EYE VIEW of the compound within the surrounding  neighbourhood setting.  Their home is in a Somali Militia controlled neighbourhood of  Nairobi. The sun has just risen, but people are already on  the move.  Beyond the safety and privacy of the walled family compound,  militia hang out on street corners and guard unofficial  checkpoint barriers on neighbourhood entrances, making it a  no-go area for the Kenyan police.  Within this no-go area they stop cars and search anyone they  suspect of being a Kenyan security police collaborator.  Four YOUNG MEN drive past Alia’s compound in a pickup truck  with a machine gun bolted on to the back.   They set the  neighbourhood tone.  As we rise higher we reveal that the whole area is a rabbit-  warren of streets, shops and market stalls.  We FADE IN our TITLE:  EYE IN THE SKY  Over this we become faintly aware of the low pulse of deep  bass music...  CUT TO:  YELLOW SHOOTING SCRIPT   12 September 2014   2.",

Jesse   knows the routine: he has a basket in here too and he  lies down in it.  The office is full of military books, files, mementoes and  photographs: her entire military career is in this room - and  we immediately understand that this is where she lives out  her life. The house is just where she sleeps.  While her computer boots up, POWELL glances at a large pin  board on a wall beside her desk:  It is covered in hand-written notes and SURVEILLANCE  PHOTOGRAPHS taken in various foreign locations of WANTED  HVI’s -   High Value Individuals.  The faces are   mostly Somali, but we also notice a young  British Muslim student named RASHEED HAMUD, and a young  American named MUHAMMAD ABDISALAAM. (Note: It does not matter  whether we know their nationality at this point, but their  dress is clearly western.)  One photograph in particular stands out from the rest:  A WHITE WOMAN wearing a deep blue head scarf (a hijab) which  covers her hair. The name   SUSAN HELEN DANFORD   appears beneath  the picture, as well as the name   “AYESHA AL-HADY.”  Another picture shows Danford without her hijab. She’s an  attractive woman in her early thirties.  In yet another she is with a man named ABDULLAH AL-HADY - who  we will learn is her husband.  Still other pictures of her show her in various foreign  locations. A few copies of different PASSPORTS show her image  with different names:   ALLISON WEST, REBECCA SUTTON.  Below the images of Danford and Al-Hady are dozens of other  YOUNG FACES - some Western dressed, some local Somali  fighters with weapons.  Some have been inked out in red.  POWELL stares at the image of Danford for a moment.  Then her computer BLEEPS and she turns to check her in-box.  An email message comes up with A PICTURE OF A YOUNG ARMY  CORPORAL in a wheelchair wearing PROSTHETIC LEGS. We read:  YELLOW SHOOTING SCRIPT   12 September 2014   4.",

The VOICE of a REPORTER plays over the footage, which cuts to  various images of Al-Shabaab Militants chanting with weapons  raised, and graphics of the geographical area described.  REPORTER’S VOICE  Somali Al-Shabaab militants have  posted this picture of an unnamed  man they say they have executed in  Nairobi. The group claims he was  working for British military  intelligence attempting to  infiltrate their international  recruitment networks. Al-Shabaab  want to impose their strict version  of Sharia law across the horn of  Africa. They bitterly resent the  role of Britain and the Kenyan  military in propping up the UN  backed Somali government in  Mogadishu. The Ministry of Defense  has declined to comment, but  denounced the execution as  “sickening.”  Affected, but stoic, POWELL watches in icy silence.  EXT. LAS VEGAS - NEVADA ",

MUSA and FATIMA stagger away from the bombed house with ALIA.  It’s a terrible image as they stagger down the street.  Someone reverses a pickup truck towards them. It’s the one we  saw earlier with the YOUNG MILITIA MEN and the machine gun  bolted onto the back.  The MILITIA MEN jump down to help MUSA and FATIMA put ALIA  into the back.  They rapidly dismount the machine gun and toss it to another  man on the street to make room in the back.  The DRIVER gets back into his cabin and drives off.  INT.
