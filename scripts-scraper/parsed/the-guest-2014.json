      "slugline": "EXT. COUNTRY ROAD - EARLY MORNING In the light of early morning, a young man RUNS along the side of a country road. He has a MILITARY RUCKSACK slung over his shoulders and is wearing an ARMY uniform. The young man’s hair is cropped short and he has an athletic build. Although he is running steadily at a fast rate, the man’s breathing is quiet and regular. The man in the army uniform continues to run as an old PICK-UP TRUCK appears in the distance behind him. INT. ANNA’S CAR - EARLY MORNING - CONTINUOUS ANNA PETERSON, a pretty 20 year old with dark hair, drives the pick-up truck down the country road. Her eyes are tired and her mascara smeared, as if she has been up all night. Anna looks through her windshield at the man running on the side of the road. He is running in the same direction that Anna is driving, so she sees only his back. Anna frowns slightly at this sight, then continues driving, moving past the young man as he runs along. Glancing at her rearview mirror, Anna watches his figure recede into the distance behind her. EXT. PETERSON HOUSE - EARLY MORNING - A HALF HOUR LATER Anna pulls her truck into the driveway of a single-story house surrounded by fields of dead grass. Two other cars are parked in the driveway, an SUV and a station wagon. Paper HALLOWEEN DECORATIONS hang outside of the house, and a homemade GHOST stands in the front yard, facing the street, its eyes black holes etched into white bedsheet. Anna climbs out of the truck. Behind her, the sun is beginning to rise, filling the sky with pale light. Anna regards the ghost standing in front of her, then heads towards the house. INT. PETERSON HOUSE - FRONT ROOM - MORNING Anna opens the front door to the house and enters, moving quietly, as if trying to not be heard.",

      "action_text": "Anna softly shuts the door behind her. She turns and sees her father, SPENCER PETERSON, 40s, seated on the couch in the dim morning light, watching her. He is wearing slacks and a dress shirt and holding a mug of coffee. Anna slumps back against the closed front door, startled. ANNA Oh. Hey. (pause) You’re up early. SPENCER Not really. Where have you been? ANNA I worked late, then went over to Kristen’s. I told mom. SPENCER It’s six in the morning, Anna. Anna moves from the door, towards the hallway. ANNA Yeah, um. I fell asleep. Sorry. SPENCER If you’re going to stay under our roof, you need to respect our rules. Walking down the hall, Anna replies without looking back. ANNA I said I was sorry. Alone, Spencer stands in the front room, facing the hall. The sound of Anna CLOSING her bedroom door is audible. Spencer turns to the mantle above the fireplace. A plastic jack-o’-lantern sits next to photos of a young man smiling, in various settings. This is CALEB PETERSON. There is a shot of Caleb in a football uniform and, most recently, a posed shot of him in an army uniform, standing with a group of soldiers in front of a military vehicle. An AMERICAN FLAG is folded into a glass frame that hangs over these photos. Spencer exhales, his shoulders slumping.  2.",

LAURA PETERSON, Anna’s mother, enters the room with a travel mug of coffee, which she sets in front of Spencer. LAURA There you go. SPENCER Thank you. Laura sits down and begins sipping from a mug of tea. LAURA Do you know when Anna got in last night? I didn’t hear her. Spencer hesitates. SPENCER I think I heard her come in just before midnight. Her car’s in the driveway. Laura nods absently. Spencer turns to Luke. SPENCER (CONT’D) Luke. You asked any girls to the fall dance yet? Luke flushes and looks down at his cereal bowl. SPENCER (CONT’D) That’s a no? LUKE I told you, dad. I’m not interested in any of the girls at my school. SPENCER Ah, well. Wait ‘til you get off to college. You done with breakfast? LUKE Yeah. Spencer rises to his feet and kisses Laura on the cheek. SPENCER See you later.  3.",

For a long moment, Laura stands in the suddenly quiet room, staring off into space. Then she blinks and begins collecting the used dishes from the dining table. INT. PETERSON HOUSE - FRONT ROOM - DAY Laura sits on the sofa, in front of the television. The TV set is on off and she is not looking at it, her gaze resting somewhere in the middle of the floor. The doorbell RINGS. Laura looks up, startled. She clumsily rises to her feet, straightens her clothing, then moves to the front door and opens it. The YOUNG MAN in army uniform who Anna saw running is standing on the porch, facing away from the door, as if surveying the front yard. He is still carrying his rucksack, his back to Laura. Laura gasps, her eyes widening. The young man turns to her, smiling politely. He is very good looking, in a boyish way, with very short blond hair. This is DAVID. David takes in Laura’s expression. He frowns, concerned. DAVID Mrs. Peterson? Laura blinks, swallowing. LAURA Yes, um, I’m sorry. I just... (trails off) Who are you? David extends his hand. DAVID My name is David, Mrs. Peterson. They shake hands, briefly.  4. DAVID (CONT’D) I knew your son, Caleb. We served together. We were friends. Laura takes this in. LAURA Won’t you come inside? DAVID Thank you, ma’am. That would be nice. INT. PETERSON HOUSE - DINING ROOM - MINUTES LATER David sits at the dining room table, his rucksack on the floor next to him. His hands are folded on the table in front of him. He looks around the room with interest. From the kitchen, Laura calls out to him: LAURA (O.S.) Are you sure I can’t get you anything? DAVID Maybe just some water would be nice. Laura comes into the room with a glass of ice water, which she hands to David. DAVID (CONT’D) Thank you, ma’am. David drinks the water, obviously very thirsty. LAURA How, um, how did you get here?

LUKE The sine is the angle of the ship’s anchor cable, so the cable is the hypotenuse, and what we need to find out is the distance down to the ocean bottom, so that’s the opposite. Do you see? DAVID (amused) Not at all. I was never too good at this stuff, I guess that’s why I went into the military. You don’t need to know much there. Can’t you just punch those numbers into a computer and it’ll do it for you? LUKE Maybe. But it doesn’t take that much longer to just work it out for yourself. Spencer is seated in front of the television, drinking a beer. He glances over, watching David work with Luke. DAVID So you’re kind of smart, huh? LUKE I guess so. I can give you an easy one. DAVID Yeah, no thanks. The front door opens and Anna enters the house. She shuts and locks the door behind her. SPENCER How did work go? ANNA Good. Not too busy.

Spencer returns, carrying two bottles of beer. David rises and takes one. Anna moves to the hallway. SPENCER Stay here, be sociable. ANNA I’m not feeling so great. I think I’m just going to lie down. SPENCER Suit yourself. Anna exits the front room. INT. PETERSON HOUSE - HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER Anna enters the hallway, moving towards her bedroom. Anna stops at the door to Caleb’s room.

The bag contains only undergarments, socks, and a tube of deodorant. Anna straightens up. Anna looks around the room, taking in Caleb’s belongings. She sighs, then sits down on the bed. Anna looks down at the pillow she is sitting on. She shifts her weight and lifts up the pillow. A polished PISTOL is beneath the pillow on Caleb’s bed. Anna takes this in, then carefully puts the pillow back into place over the gun, as before. Anna starts to stand up, looking to the door. DAVID IS STANDING in the doorway to the room, WATCHING HER. Anna gasps and quickly stands, taking a step back. DAVID Hey there. ANNA I, um, I’m sorry. I just... I just come in here sometimes. DAVID No, it’s okay. I’m sorry to have interrupted you. Don’t mind me. David moves quietly from the doorway, towards the bathroom. Anna rapidly exits Caleb’s bedroom, heading towards her own room. INT.

But since he’s got a degree, suddenly he’s regional manager.I know Laura, she wonders what’s going on, if I’m ever going to make any money. Spencer goes silent, immersed in thought. DAVID Your wife seems to respect you, sir. SPENCER Yeah.   (beat) So what about you? What are your plans? DAVID I haven’t really given that much thought. Figured I’d get on a bus tomorrow, head towards Florida and start looking for work. I’ve done contracting work before, I’m sure I could find something. SPENCER That’s crazy. You... you should stay with us a couple more days. Look for jobs online. DAVID I couldn’t impose on your hospitality any longer, sir. SPENCER No, that’s... and what’s with this “sir” business?

PETERSON HOUSE - CALEB’S ROOM - NIGHT - LATER In Caleb’s bedroom, David lies on the bed, fully dressed. He is visible by moonlight coming in through the window. David lies completely still. A breeze moves the barren branches of the tree outside; they shift, CREAKING. David glances over at this sound. After a moment, David quietly rises from the bed. EXT. HIGH SCHOOL - DAY Dozens of students pour out of the high school at the end of the school day. Luke slouches among them, looking at the ground.

LUKE Well, most of them give me a hard time. Those two guys, Mike and Ian, are the worst. Those guys are real assholes. DAVID Which is which? LUKE Ian’s the big one, Mike’s the guy with blond hair. David watches as one of the pick-up trucks is driven away by Jason.   Mike and Ian climb into the second truck with their girlfriends. LUKE (CONT’D) Can we go now? DAVID Yes.

LAURA’S CAR - DAY - CONTINUOUS Luke watches David drive with growing concern. David remains focused on the pick-up truck ahead of them. LUKE What are you doing?  23. Up ahead, the pick-up turns into the parking lot of a small DIVE BAR. Jason’s pick-up truck is already parked in the lot. DAVID They’re going to a bar?

Don’t come out unless you hear me or the police. Okay? Luke hesitates, then nods, staring as if dazed. He steps back behind the stack of barrels, disappearing from view. Anna quickly shifts one of the barrels, further hiding Luke. ANNA (CONT’D) (whispering) I’ll come back for you. Anna turns and runs deeper into the dark maze. Anna turns a corner, then another. She finds herself facing a DEAD END. Hurriedly, Anna backtracks to her last turn, going the other direction, disappearing from view. On the other side of the maze wall from Anna, David walks deeper into the maze, turning corners, still holding the BLOODY BOX CUTTER in front of him. David speaks LOUDLY. DAVID I’m really sorry about this, guys. David turns another corner. A scarecrow leans against one wall of this corridor. David ignores it, calling out. DAVID (CONT’D) I tried to think of another way to do it. Any other solution. Hidden behind the barrels, Luke goes quiet. David’s FOOTSTEPS are audible near him. FAKE LIGHTNING FLASHES from a source overhead. Moving carefully, Luke peers out between the barrels. As Luke watches, David steps into the chamber, looking around. David moves forward, holding the BOX CUTTER. David slowly WALKS PAST LUKE’s hiding place, SCRAPING the BLADE against a chain link fence that lines the corridor. He continues speaking as he MOVES AWAY.  105. DAVID (CONT’D) Are you guys hiding? There’s no point. I locked the back door. I have to find you. Luke goes completely still as David passes him, barely breathing. He watches as David moves away from him, nearing the chamber’s exit. David comes to a stop at the chamber’s exit. He looks around, then goes perfectly still, listening. Luke silently reaches into his pocket and pulls out the BUTTERFLY KNIFE David gave him.

Firefighters in full protection gear, including hoods and breathing masks, are moving in and out of the building. The sound of fire deterrent foam SPRAYING is audible within. Smoke billows out from the door. The paramedic looks to the volunteer firefighter. PARAMEDIC What’s the deal? FIREMAN Guess there’s two bodies in there, both of them burned up pretty bad. One of the guys said their teeth are missing, got knocked out, so I don’t know what the deal is. Soon as they give us the clear, we go in. The paramedic nods, watching masked men in full body protection gear exit the building. EXT. HIGH SCHOOL PARKING LOT - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS At the rear of the ambulance, Luke leans over and rests his head on Anna’s shoulder. Anna puts her arm around him. She looks around, surveying the activity around the smoldering building. As Anna watches, one of the masked fireman emerges from behind the building. He turns his head around in all directions, then looks over at Anna. Anna notices the masked fireman watching her. She blinks, tired, then turns away, staring out into the distance, at the dark night sky. Next to her, Luke closes his eyes. The masked fireman watches Anna and Luke for another moment, then turns and LIMPS AWAY, disappearing into the darkness of the field behind the building. FADE OUT.  111.",
