She balances a LAUNDRY BASKET next to her PREGNANT BELLY. She stands before a CALENDAR on the wall, charting each day of her pregnancy. She crosses off another day and hands the crayon back to -- Will, who colors in a NEW DRAWING. His hands dig loudly through a tin of crayons. Mia waves her finger. Will freezes, reprimanded for the hundredth time. He reaches under his parent’s bed for a pair of oversized WINTER GLOVES. He places the gloves over each hand, then quietly resumes his search.  INT. FARMHOUSE, HALL - DAY  Mia walks past April and collects her dirt-stained sweater into the laundry basket.  INT. FARMHOUSE, LAUNDRY ROOM - DAY  We follow Mia to the WASHER AND DRYER. The machines have been unplugged. She empties the basket into the washer. Adds water and soap. Lightly stirs the clothes with her hands. Mia stops momentarily. The purple iris floats in the water. An idea strikes her - she leans over to a MARKER BOARD labeled BABY NAMES and adds IRIS to the list. A hand cuts the frame, immediately crossing out IRIS.  JOHN   (40s), the patriarch of the family, shakes his head. An MP3 PLAYER plays MUSIC in his headphones that we can’t hear. John points to another name on the list: HOLLY. Mia playfully purses her lips. He places a comforting hand over her bump. John puts one of his EARBUDS into her ear. Our world is filled with MUSIC - maybe a song from when they first met. 2.",

And as they move together about the house, a theme materializes in the background: Every inch of wall and floor has been painstakingly covered with THICK PADDING. Sometimes FOAM, sometimes WOOL INSULATION. Too ugly to be an aesthetic choice. Must be product of necessity.  INT. FARMHOUSE, DINING ROOM - LATE AFTERNOON  Mia sets the table. All of their plates and cutlery are plastic. She gestures to John to gather the children for dinner.  INT. FARMHOUSE, UPSTAIRS - LATE AFTERNOON  John tops the stairs. He opens a DOOR, labeled “Will” in stenciled letters. Will sits at his desk, finishing his drawing. John MIMES an eating motion. Will acknowledges. John moves on to the SECOND DOOR, labeled “April” in a flower- patterned alphabet. Peeks his head inside... It’s empty. John moves further down the hall to a THIRD DOOR. No letters on this one - only a sun-faded patch, suggesting a name was once removed. He hesitates before opening the door --  INT. FARMHOUSE, BEDROOM - LATE AFTERNOON  April sits on a stripped MATTRESS FRAME in a sparsely decorated room. Looks like someone used to live here long ago. She closes the DIARY she’s writing in, annoyed by the intrusion. John MIMES the eating motion and extends his hand, encouraging her to join. April rises from the bed and approaches, her arm outstretched as if she’ll grab John’s hand BUT -- APRIL CLOSES THE DOOR IN HIS FACE. 3.",

John unfolds a MONOPOLY game board as April finally joins from upstairs. She takes the furthest seat from John. April’s mood changes as she tussles with Will over who gets to roll first. They play the game mostly with hand gestures, never speaking a word. They roll the DICE on a soft blanket so that it doesn’t make a sound. Will is five spaces away from landing on April’s BOARDWALK. He silently prays for a miracle. Will rolls a... five. He throws up his hands in protest. April lets out a GIGGLE. The first sound we’ve heard this whole time -- JOHN’S EYES WIDEN. APRIL COVERS HER MOUTH. EVERYONE GETS DEADLY STILL. AFRAID. AND THEN WE HEAR IT. A SCREAM IN THE DISTANCE. IT IS NOT HUMAN. The family exchanges worried glances. John edges over to the window, watching the horizon for any sign of movement. Nothing. THEN THE SCREAM SLOWLY STARTS TO MOVE AWAY. April removes her hand from her mouth. Everyone starts to relax. They go back to playing Monopoly in silence. TITLE:   A QUIET PLACE  4.",

Focuses on the wall of corn lining the backyard. Tries to bark through the MUZZLE but can’t.  EXT. CORN FIELD - NIGHT  There are no crickets or insects of any kind. Just an unnatural silence that hangs in the air. AND THEN SOMETHING MOVES. STALKS OF CORN WHIP AND BEND AS A LARGE FORM MANEUVERS THROUGH THE CROPS...  EXT. FARMHOUSE - DAWN  Morning. The yard is serene and still. A heavy layer of frost covers the grass.  INT. FARMHOUSE, HALL - MORNING  April’s tiny face peeks out into the hall. She wipes the sleep from her eyes.  INT. FARMHOUSE, BATHROOM - MORNING  April lifts the toilet seat. There’s no water inside the bowl, just a red BIOHAZARD BAG curled around the rim. She pees into the bag and her face goes from agony to relief.  INT. FARMHOUSE, BASEMENT - MORNING  April descends the BASEMENT STAIRS with the biohazard bag. There is a NAIL sticking up about ten steps down, and if someone were to step on it... ... it would REALLY, REALLY HURT . APRIL’S FOOT COMES DOWN ON THE NAIL, but just misses it. 5.",

An old WORKBENCH cluttered with family PHOTOS from ages ago. April glances at a POLAROID of a   TEENAGE GIRL : braces, dark eyes, beautiful. She’s hugging April. They’re both laughing. The Polaroid seems to be attached to a PAINFUL MEMORY. And like everything in this basement, it has the look of something that was abandoned long ago. A HAND TOUCHES APRIL’S SHOULDER. John is standing behind his daughter. April doesn’t look over. Doesn’t react. If we hadn’t noticed before, we realize now that there is an enormous amount of tension between them. April’s face starts to quiver. Tears filling her eyes. She pushes her father’s hand away and leaves. John opens his mouth as if to say something, but of course... he can’t.  EXT. VALLEY - MORNING  John has a LARGE DUFFLE slung around his shoulder. He leads Will down a steep trail into a lake valley. As they walk, we may or may not notice how they always: 1) Avoid dry leaves and sticks 2) Walk heel to toe 3) Distribute their weight evenly 4) Keep their arms close to their sides 5) Breathe steadily 6) Match the cadence of each other’s gait  EXT. LAKE - MORNING  Will sits into a small ROW-BOAT with no paddles. He hides his trembling hands. Doesn’t want his father to know he’s scared. John sits behind him and gazes at the placid water. A layer of RED ALGAE covers the entire basin. It is thick and milky along the shore, where the SKELETONS of cows, horses, and fish waste away. 6. There’s a long ROPE that extends from one side of the lake to the other. It’s been secured to a post on each end and pulled taught, hanging no more than a few inches above the surface. The men begin pulling themselves along the rope, slowly at first; careful not to disrupt or splash the water in any way. Their boat glides across the calm lake, gaining momentum, heading to a SMALL GROVE OF TREES on the other side.  EXT. WELL ",

FARMHOUSE - DAY  Mia searches everywhere for the dog. An impossible task when you can’t hear your pet, and your pet can’t hear you.  INT. FARMHOUSE, UPSTAIRS - DAY  Mia stops at the top of the stairs. She cringes, feels a small pang in her stomach. It passes.  EXT. FARMHOUSE - DAY  Outside, April crumples up the drawing. Her eyes trained on the SHED as its doors sway in the wind. She approaches.  INT. SHED - DAY  April’s tiny hands open the large shed doors and we see inside for the first time: In the center is a CRIB with a MOBILE hanging over it. The surrounding walls are built like a bomb shelter of sorts - heavily reinforced with sound dampening materials. Much like the farmhouse, but more extreme. ...they’ve been preparing for the baby’s arrival for months.  INT. FARMHOUSE, CHILDREN’S BEDROOM - DAY  Mia gets down on all fours and peers under April’s bed. She sees something that puzzles her. Takes a moment to register. The POLAROID OF THE TEENAGE GIRL from the basement is buried under a pile of clothes. Mia examines it for a moment, then places it back. Mia moves to the hall. She staggers a little. Feels dizzy. 8.",

The process is SLOW and DILIGENT, with no room for error. April teases Will while he works. He pushes her away. A little too hard. She frowns, her feelings hurt.  INT. FARMHOUSE, BATHROOM - DAY  Mia sits in a BATH TUB. Her face red. Doing everything she can to not make a sound. Fighting an immense amount of pain.  INT. SHED - LATER STILL  John stands on a LADDER, fastening a sheet to the ceiling. About half the stack has been put up. When no one is looking, April pulls one of the sheets off the wall. She smiles to herself, almost wants to get caught, but no one sees her.  INT. FARMHOUSE, BATHROOM - DAY  Mia’s contractions increase.  INT. SHED - EVEN LATER  The sun is lower in the sky. Much progress has been made on the walls and ceiling, which are now 60% covered in sound proofing. April wanders past THREE BUNKS: one for John & Mia, one for Will, and one for herself. April’s bunk is half-decorated with STICKERS and a Wizard of Oz SCARECROW plush toy. April grabs a PILLOW from her bed. Looks to her brother mischievously.  INT.

April sulks away, angry. Steps outside the shed and STOPS. She sees the RED FLOOD LIGHTS ARE ON. She panics, runs back to the shed and grabs her father. He starts to get scared when he realizes how scared she is.  EXT. FARMHOUSE - AFTERNOON  John runs across the lawn as fast as he can. Throws the front door open. No time for shoe covers.  INT. FARMHOUSE, UPSTAIRS - AFTERNOON  Sprints up the stairs.  INT. FARMHOUSE, BATHROOM - AFTERNOON  Finds his wife in the bathtub. She’s in labor.  EXT. SHED - AFTERNOON  Will and April run off in the opposite direction of the farmhouse. It’s as if they’ve been rehearsing for this moment for months.  EXT. WOODS - AFTERNOON  They enter a small patch of forest. Fast as they can.  EXT. WOODS, PATH - AFTERNOON  April trips and falls. Will doesn’t stop to help her.  INT. WOODS, HORSE STALL - AFTERNOON  Will lunges into an empty horse stall. He tips over a TOOL BOX and grabs a pack of MATCHES. 11. INT. FARMHOUSE, BATHROOM - AFTERNOON  Mia’s face is flush and sweaty. A pool of blood surrounds her. She breathes heavy as... A NEWBORN BABY BEGINS TO   CRY   --  EXT. WOODS, PATH - AFTERNOON  -- April gets very still. She turns up the VOLUME on her hearing aid. Just faintly, through the high frequency static, we hear the baby CRYING in the distance. April stifles her breathing. The sound of SOMETHING else continues breathing behind her. OUT OF FOCUS, JUST TEN FEET AWAY, WE SEE   IT   MOVE SLOWLY TOWARDS THE SOUNDS.  INT. FARMHOUSE, UPSTAIRS - AFTERNOON  Mia takes the crying baby in her arms. She covers it with a FLEECE BLANKET, trying to dampen the cries. John looks out the window at the shed. Wondering how to get there safely.

April looks up to the broken platform. She can almost reach it. April tries to stand. BUT HER ANKLES BEGIN TO SINK. THE GRAIN IS LIKE QUICK SAND. THE MORE SHE MOVES, THE DEEPER SHE DROWNS.

Zero . That is how many people can survive being buried under grain without air for a few minutes.  EXT. GRAVEL ROAD - AFTERNOON  John sprints after the movement in the crops.  INT. SILO - AFTERNOON  April’s body thrashes in the dark. Fleeting trickles of light come through as the grain stirs, but it’s mostly BLACK. April takes huge desperate breaths.

It travels through the grain like a distorted sonic --  BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOM!!!!!!!  The wall RUPTURES below. Grain starts spilling outside. April is carried with the current, edging closer and closer to the puncture hole. Closer and closer to DAYLIGHT. Someone has saved her. Maybe Will? Maybe her father?

They have one important thing in common - their necks are broken and all of their VOCAL CORDS have been ripped out. Above is a mostly HOLLOW TUNNEL, with a single LADDER that runs all the way to the top of the tubular steel tower. The tower itself is bisected by 3 platforms along the way, each with a GATE that can be opened or closed. John is nervous. Keeps checking his watch. The journey took longer than planned. He sets the final TIMER and starts to climb the ladder.  TIMER #3:   22 minutes By the way, it takes approximately 30 minutes to climb the Statue of Liberty, so if John wants to get to the top of this turbine before the timers go off, he needs to HAUL ASS.
