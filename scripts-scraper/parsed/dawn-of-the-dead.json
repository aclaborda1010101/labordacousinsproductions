The woman's face begins to twitch, as though she is having a bad dream. She moans slightly and her expression grows more desperate. A mix of subtle sounds begin to fade in. As they get louder, we can discern what sounds like a busy office area. It is actually a frantic television studio with the hum of panic in a national emergency.",
