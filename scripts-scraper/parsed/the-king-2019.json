Grey eyes him with contempt. Cambridge looks at him cautiously, searching. William approaches Hal with something more like compassion. He genuflects subtly. WILLIAM My lord. Your father expects you. HAL He shouldn’t. William observes Hal’s state of dishevelment.  INT. GREAT HALL / ROYAL COURT - DAY  King Henry is in his chair, visibly weak, presiding over a sitting of parliament. The full court plus THE ARCHBISHOP OF CANTERBURY and clerical attendants are there. THOMAS OF LANCASTER, the King’s 18 year-old son, Hal’s younger brother, is there too. The Archbishop is addressing the king. He’s bumptious, but nervous, and has a lisp. ARCHBISHOP Never. Never would I dare doubt Your Majesty’s piety, however I would remind you of the service we - HENRY IV Archbishop, I would have thought our lord above would want us all to share in his bounty. ARCHBISHOP My liege, while I see the strain your treasury is under, I can not help but wonder if the canker of Lollardy be somehow at the root of this suggestion, that I - or rather the   church   - be burdened with a tax to relieve problems that are not of the church’s making. WILLIAM Your Highness. 16.",

He regards Hal with derision. Hal crosses the room. He bows before his father, taking in his frailty. Henry takes in his son’s slovenliness. HENRY IV (CONT’D) Come closer. Hal takes a step closer. Henry watches him a moment. HENRY IV (CONT’D) I feel my life is nearing its natural end and yet still even I must appear of ruder health than you. Hal doesn’t respond. He continues looking his father in the eye. HENRY IV (CONT’D) The time has come for me to consider the issue of my succession. You will not be king. Hal remains fixed. A barely concealed smirk on the face of Grey. HENRY IV (CONT’D) While you are my eldest son, for reasons that must be evident to you, that are on display for all here to see and smell, you will not inherit this crown. HAL Nor have I sought it. HENRY IV That privilege and responsibility will instead fall to your brother Thomas. Thomas straightens, postures regally. It doesn’t suit him. 17. HENRY IV (CONT’D) As you may be aware - to whatever degree you are aware of the world outside your own - I will assume you are aware that the kingdom is at war with itself. Matters as grave as these require leadership committed to their resolution and you - of this I am sure - you can not provide that commitment. Thomas, however, can. He is soft, but he is eager and he will lead my army against the newly treasonous Percy Hotspur. Hal looks at Thomas who has trouble meeting Hal’s eyes. HENRY IV (CONT’D) I will assume this news comes to you as neither surprise nor disappointment. I do however see it as my duty as King and as father to say it to you directly. Hal walks to Thomas. Thomas raises his head, holds Hal’s eyes. HAL How do you feel, brother? THOMAS Strong. HAL When do you fight? THOMAS I set off tomorrow. We fight by week’s end. HAL You need not fight.

Thomas is helped into his breastplate by an AMROURER. He’s nervous. He raises his arm as a strap is tightened. A CAPTAIN waits nearby. THOMAS (pained) Is it not too tight? ARMOURER It has been made to the measurements I was given, sire. THOMAS May be you were given the wrong ones. It feels tight. I can barely turn. ARMOURER It is to be worn tight, sire. Thomas steps away like he’s trying on new shoes. He seems awkward in his heavy suit, overwhelmed by it. He walks among men nearby. He smiles wanly. The men regard him with uncertainty.

THOMAS (CONT’D) Why are you here? HAL I will not allow this havoc to transpire. I have come to see it stopped. THOMAS This is my battle. You have no place here. HAL If I have my way there will be no battle. Hal turns to a HERALD nearby. HAL (CONT’D) You. Come here. THOMAS You have no place here.

Northumberland and Scrope have arrived on horseback from the rebel camp. They watch the fight. Another vicious exchange. The men break. They watch each other, catching breath. They circle one another. 26. HOTSPUR (CONT’D) Come for me again, dog. Hal raises his sword and stands firm and waits. Hotspur fixes coldly on him, then charges. The exchange is brutal. Hal loses his sword. He stands vulnerable. He pulls his dagger from its scabbard. Hotspur laughs from behind his visor, then charges again. Hal ducks, spins. Hotspur trips and falls. Hal wheels around and thrusts his dagger straight through Hotspur’s throat. Hotspur is killed. Hal stands over him, heaving for breath.

I find we have lost our way. Hal assays the Dauphin and his men. DAUPHIN (CONT’D) Please, sit. Or I beg your pardon. He stands. DAUPHIN (CONT’D)  You   must invite   me , of course. This is your domain. Hal doesn’t move. The Dauphin sits again, raises his cup. DAUPHIN (CONT’D) To your little victory. Hal stares. DAUPHIN (CONT’D) Do you wonder why I have come? The Dauphin looks to Hal, then to William and Falstaff, then back to Hal. He raises his eyebrows. 72.",

I have come instead to describe for you your end days, the screams of your men as they die slow. The Dauphin stares at Hal, trying to be intimidating. DAUPHIN (CONT’D) And so, King of England, you seem so intent on making France your new home, I will help you. I will drain your body of its blood and I will bury it under a tree. A little French tree. Very young and small. Since perchance that is fitting of your mind to come here. Small. And maybe your - He gestures to his cock. DAUPHIN (CONT’D) But no, your balls must be big. His humour is forced. He smiles a gloating smile to his men. DAUPHIN (CONT’D) A tiny little cock. And giant balls! The Dauphin laughs falsely and loudly, then sobers. DAUPHIN (CONT’D) And the sound of your wives and children weeping I will use to lull me to sleep at night. Oh, but of course there is no one for you? To weep for you? No wife or children? No? I might just use   that   thought to lull me to sleep at night. Falstaff yawns wide and loud. The Dauphin is taken aback. FALSTAFF Pardon me. Hal stares dully at the Dauphin. 73. DAUPHIN Have you heard what I have said? HAL I have. It was stirring. (to Falstaff) Sir John, walk with me. Falstaff nods and stands. Hal puts his hand on William’s shoulder and smiles to the room. HAL (CONT’D) Good night, all. WILLIAM Good night, Your Majesty. Hal exits.  EXT. CAMP / HARFLEUR TOWN OUTSKIRTS - NIGHT  Hal and Falstaff walk between tents. Hal is dark and focussed. HAL Ready the men to move. Waste no time.  EXT. FRENCH COUNTRYSIDE - DAY  Hal rides the length of his massive army train. Weary men. Many are sick with dysentery - archers, food carriages, masons, livestock. And shackled French prisoners on foot.

They survey the camp, beginning its preparations. HAL Is this folly? WILLIAM As you say, my liege, I am not a soldier. Tis not for me to question your instinct. I can advise on strategy, not tactic. I would say I fear the pall it should cast on the vigour of your fresh crown were we to return home today. To be sure, defeat here might cast that same pall. Retreat would guarantee it.  EXT. ENGLISH CAMP / AGINCOURT - MORNING  In amongst the wider battle preparations around the camp, Westmorland briefs a contingent of twenty knights, seated and standing and rumbling with disquiet. WESTMORLAND These are the King’s orders. We are to fight unarmoured, and without chargers. KNIGHT We are to be sacrificed. Is that what he asks of us? WESTMORLAND His belief is that fighting unarmoured and unmounted will not only secure us victory, it is the surest way to keep you alive. KNIGHT Rot. WESTMORLAND And I will say this: if our King  were   to ask you to sacrifice yourself, for the greater good of the realm, I’d expect you honour that request as any loyal and stouthearted subject should. 86.",

Horses sense looming danger and scuff hoofs in the dirt. Hal rounds a corner to find Falstaff outside the armoury tent, being dressed in his heavy armour. Metal all over. He sees Hal. FALSTAFF This wind whips from the north. (smiles) These are clouds sent from England. HAL Why are you being fitted? We were to fight without plate. FALSTAFF We need a front line to draw them in. HAL It can’t be you. FALSTAFF The idea was mine. Some man must lead that first push to sell it well. Falstaff fastens his armour. FALSTAFF (CONT’D) My men have been assembled. Most would   rather   wear the full suit. It gives comfort. And I can’t in all good conscience send them down there to realise my speculative drivel without getting muddy alongside them. HAL I will fight with you. FALSTAFF (smiles) Noble. You know it can’t be. The armourer lifts Falstaff’s shoulder plate over his head. 87. FALSTAFF (CONT’D) Hal. (corrects himself, smiles)  My liege .

Be sure not to join it early. Promise that. No matter what you see down there. We must first draw them all in. All of them. Falstaff rests his palm on Hal’s cheek. FALSTAFF (CONT’D) We win. It will be an honour. So win, my friend. And maybe then you’ll lighten enough to have a drink with me. He grabs his helmet and waddles away. Hal watches him, lost.  EXT. ENGLISH CAMP / AGINCOURT - MORNING  Light rain continues to fall. Hal strides between tents, distressed. His horse is tethered, attendants in wait. He checks and tightens its saddle. The Archbishop appears beside him. An attendant holds an umbrella over the Archbishop. ARCHBISHOP Your Majesty, I have come to wish you well. I hope to offer a prayer for the men bef",

When the French line hits these weapons are speared into the breasts and legs of horses that fall and thrash. French knights are thrown into the mud and all hell breaks loose.

When the knight stops moving he tries desperately to get back to his feet - near impossible with men and horses right on top of him.
