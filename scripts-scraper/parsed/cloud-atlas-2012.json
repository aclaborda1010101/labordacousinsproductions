LUISA   REY He   wasn't   looking   that   well   the last   time   I   saw   him   and   I'm   just worried   that   something   happened-- The   elevator   opens,   revealing   Bill   Smoke. 81. As   Smoke   passes   them,   he   looks   at   Luisa   and   in   the   look   there is   something   that   reminds   us   of   the   look   Old   Georgie   gave   to Zachry.  INT.   AIRPORT   HOTEL   ROOM   1404   -   NIGHT   -   YEAR   1973  The   manager   opens   the   door   and   Luisa   follows   him   in. MANAGER Oh   my   god-- Luisa   covers   her   mouth.   Sixsmith   lays   awkwardly   on   the   bed, blood   Pollock-ing   the   wall,   the   gun   Smoke   used,   now   in Sixsmith's   hand. LUISA   REY Go!   Call   the   police!   Hurry! The   manager   rushes   out   while   Luisa   quickly   scans   the   room. The   report   and   the   letter   are   gone. The   room   seems   completely   clean,   until,   coming   up   from looking   under   the   bed,   she   notices   a   tiny   bit   of   aged   paper underneath   Sixsmith's   back. She   softly   pushes   him   to   the   side   and   reveals   the   thick   pack of   letters. FROBISHER   (V.O.) My   Dear   Sixsmith,   How   I   wish   you were   here   with   me   now.  INT.   AYRS'   CHATEAU,   SCARLET   ROOM   -   DAY   -   YEAR   1931  TADEUSZ   AUGUSTOWSKI,   the   Polish   conductor   and   colleague   of Ayrs   is   reading   \"Der   Todtenvogel,\"   Ayrs   and   Frobisher's latest   collaboration.",

      "action_text": "FROBISHER   (V.O.) Today   Ayrs   and   I   presented   our first   collaboration,   a   short   tone poem   called   \"Der   Todtenvogel\",   to Tadeusz   Augustowski,   Ayrs' favourite   conductor.   It's   an intriguing   animal.   It   borrows resonances   from   Wagner's   Ring,   then disintegrates   the   theme   into   a Stravinskyesque   nightmare   policed by   Sibelian   wraiths.   Horrible, delectable,   wish   you   could   hear   it. 82. Augustowski   sways   gently   to   the   music   in   his   head,   hand lightly   bobbing   in   the   air   as   if   floating   on   an   invisible current. FROBISHER   (V.O.)   (CONT'D) It's   the   most   accomplished   tone poem   I   know   of   written   since   the war   and   I   tell   you,   Sixsmith,   that more   than   a   few   of   its   best   ideas are   mine.   Suppose   an   amanuensis must   reconcile   himself   to renouncing   his   share   in   authorship, though   Vyvyan   recently   referred   to our   work   as   a   upartnership.\"  Frobisher   and   Ayrs   subtly   watch   in   expectation.   Augustowski's monocle   falls   from   his   eye   socket.   He   turns   to   Ayrs. AUGUSTOWSKI A   man   at   our   time   of   life,   Ayrs-- has   no   right   to   such   daring   ideas. Where   are   you   getting   'em   from? Ayrs   puffs   himself   up. AYRS I   suppose   I've   won   a   rearguard action   or   two   in   my   war   against decrepitude.   My   boy   Robert   here   is proving   a   valuable   aide-de-camp. Frobisher   smiles,   lifting   a   tea   pot. FROBISHER More   tea?  INT.   LUISA'S   APARTMENT   -   NIGHT   -   YEAR   1973  Luisa   is   smoking   a   joint,   reading   Frobisher's   letters.   Her apartment   is   cramped,   cluttered   but   comfortable. 83. On   one   of   the   brick   and   board   bookshelves   we   see   a   picture   of her   father,   Lester   Rey. Behind   her,   a   shadow   drops   from   the   balcony   above.

SONMI-451 Because   it   was   the   first   time   a Pureblood   had   showed   me   a   kindness.  INT.   THE   PROPHETESS   -   EWING'S   ROOM   -   NIGHT   -   YEAR   1846  87. Ewing   returns   to   his   room.   It   appears   empty.   He   slips   one of   the   barrels   in   front   of   the   door,   blocking   it. EWING Come   on,   then. The   wiry   man   slides   out   from   the   darkness   of   his   hiding place,   a   wide   smile   across   his   face   when   he   sees   Ewing   pull food   from   his   pockets. AUTUA Ohhh,   thank   ya'   missa   Ewing.   Missa D'Anrnoq   right   about   you. EWING Don't   mention   that   mongrel's   name again.   To   tell   the   truth,   I   was worried   you   might   try   to   eat   me   if you   didn't   get   something   in   that stomach. AUTUA You   safe,   missa   Ewing.   I   no   like white   meat. Autua   smiles,   gobbling   the   stale   bread   and   cheese. EWING Before   I   decide   what   I   am   going   to do   with   you,   tell   me   why   you   were being   whipped   so   savagely.

EWING Why   did   you   look   at   me? AUTUA Pain   strong,   aye,   but   friend's   eyes more   strong. EWING You're   a   runaway   slave.   I'm   a lawyer.   How   do   you   imagine   we   could possibly   be   friends. 88. He   keeps   chewing   and   smiling   as   jabs   his   finger   from   his   eyes to   Ewing's. AUTUA Here   all   you   need.  INT.   AYR'S   CHATEAU   -   MUSIC   ROOM   -   NIGHT   -   YEAR   1931  A   study   of   anticipation   as   they   wait   for   Jocasta   to   open   a telegram. FROBISHER   (V.O.) Telegram   arrived   with   reviews   of \"Todtenvogel.\" JOCASTA Before   I   open   this,   Vyvyan,   I   need you   to   promise   me-- AYRS Please,   Jocasta,   I   am   too   old   to worry   about   what   a   bunch   of parasitic   half-wits   think   of   my music.   Just   read   the   damn   thing and   then   consign   it   to   the   fire. Unconvinced,   she   peels   open   the   envelope. JOCASTA First   Performance   Mystified   Stop. Ayrs   rubs   the   whiskers   around   his   tightening   lips. JOCASTA   (CONT'D) Second   Performance   Fisticuffs   Stop. Frobisher's   eyebrow   arches   in   anticipation.

She   is   almost   unable   to   finish   it   for   the   joy   bubbling   out   of her. Frobisher   can't   feel   his   feet   on   the   ground. AYRS Well   ...   even   a   broken   clock   is right   twice   a   day. A   smile   spreads. AYRS   (CONT'D) Jocasta,   open   a   bottle   of   the   '08 Pinot   Rouge.   I   make   it   a   point   to never   be   toasted   without   a   drink   in my   hand. She   leaves,   her   own   smile   flashing   at   Frobisher   ",
