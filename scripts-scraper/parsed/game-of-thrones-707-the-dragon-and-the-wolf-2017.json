GREY WORM stands at the head of the central phalanx. He looks ahead, to the walls of King’s Landing.  EXT. KING’S LANDING BATTLEMENTS - DAY  We see the Unsullied from a high, distant perspective: BRONN’s perspective, specifically, as he inspects the LANNISTER FORCES on the city walls. This is what a true Lannister deployment looks like: a line of soldiers stretching into the distance as far as the eye can see, prepared for an attack from any point. Bronn looks over the battlement to see many more men at the ready in the courtyard below, where many barrels are also being stacked. A LANNISTER GENERAL on the battlements supervises the barrel stacking. Bronn questions the man: BRONN Oil? LANNISTER GENERAL Pitch, my lord. Bronn looks at the barrels in the courtyard. BRONN How many barrels? LANNISTER GENERAL Five hundred, my lord. Bronn looks out at the Unsullied. BRONN Get five hundred more. LANNISTER GENERAL Yes, my lord. The general leaves to see to his order. Bronn continues down the battlements, to JAIME LANNISTER. (CONTINUED)  GAME OF THRONES   \"The Dragon and the Wolf\"   1 .",

They both look out at the Unsullied for a moment. BRONN Men without cocks. Wouldn’t find me fighting in an army if I had no cock. What’s left to fight for? JAIME Gold? BRONN I spent my life around soldiers. What do you think they spend that gold on? Point taken. JAIME Family? BRONN Not without a cock, you don’t. Hmm. JAIME Maybe it really is all cocks in the end. BRONN (re: Unsullied) And yet, your brother has chosen to side with the cockless. JAIME Yes, he’s always been a champion of the downtrodden. A trumpet sounds from a tower above. Jaime and Bronn return their attention to the distance. CONTINUED:  GAME OF THRONES   \"The Dragon and the Wolf\"   2 .",

The Dothraki pour through the gaps in the Unsullied phalanxes; their passage does not cause a single Unsullied to flinch.  EXT. KING’S LANDING BATTLEMENTS - DAY  The Dothraki present their customary show of strength before the city walls, a cyclone of horse and steel and screaming warriors, swirling before the immobile Unsullied. And then, without warning or apparent signal, they stop in front of the Unsullied and fall silent, in ready position, eerily motionless, staring up at the nervous defenders of the city. BRONN I think we’re about to be the downtrodden.  EXT. DANY'S FLAGSHIP - DAY  TYRION LANNISTER stands on the starboard deck of Dany’s flagship, standing next to VARYS and THEON GREYJOY. He steps away from them, heading toward the bow, where JON SNOW stands with DAVOS SEAWORTH. Tyrion joins them. The three men look at King’s Landing, in the distance. Nearby JORAH MORMONT and MISSANDEI look across the water, and the few escort ships following behind their flagship. Dany herself is notably absent. JON How many people live here? TYRION A million, give or take. Jon tries to get his head around this notion. JON That’s more people than we have in the entire North.

DANY'S FLAGSHIP - STORAGE AREA - DAY  In a dark storage area below decks, amidst various crates and sacks of food, THE HOUND approaches a crate that is separate from the rest. The top is padlocked on two sides. He stands in front of it and listens to the silence. He raises a finger, and taps the crate once, quietly. A barrage of thumping and snarling explodes from inside the crate, shaking it on the floorboards. Satisfied that their precious cargo is undead and well, the Hound walks away.  INT. CERSEI'S BEDROOM - DAY  CERSEI LANNISTER has heard news from QYBURN. Jaime is also present. THE MOUNTAIN stands at his post nearby, silent as always. CERSEI Why isn’t she with them? QYBURN I’m afraid I don’t know, your grace. No one has seen her. CERSEI And the rest of them? QYBURN They’re on their way to the Dragonpit now. CERSEI Including our brother? QYBURN Yes, your grace. Cersei approaches the Mountain. CONTINUED:   JON (CONT'D) (CONTINUED)  GAME OF THRONES   \"The Dragon and the Wolf\"   4 . CERSEI If anything goes wrong, kill the silver-haired bitch first. Then our brother, then the bastard who calls himself king. The rest of them you can kill in any order you see fit. Ser Gregor nods. Both Jaime and Qyburn appear troubled. CERSEI Come, Ser Gregor. It’s time for us to meet our guests. Ser Gregor opens the door. Cersei leaves her chambers. Jaime, Qyburn and Gregor follow.  EXT. ROAD TO DRAGONPIT - DAY  Tyrion, Jon and company approach on the main road: Davos, Varys, Missandei, Jorah, Theon. QHONO and nine other DOTHRAKI march with them, keeping a watchful eye. They wear the burnt, torn, bloodied coats of Lannister officers they murdered in ep.704. The Hound brings up the rear of the procession, walking alongside a donkey cart, which carries the padlocked crate seen in the hold of the ship previously. Dany is still not here. Missandei lo",

EASTWATCH, TOP OF THE WALL - DAY  As before, we fly to the Wall with a flock of birds, piloted by Bran. A bunch of them land on the Wall battlements above Eastwatch. TORMUND walks the battlements, gazing north for the enemy he knows is coming. He looks down the battlements to BERIC, who is up here with him, along with a few other WILDLINGS. They’ve all taken well to the strange role of serving as guardians of the Wall. BERIC It’s a long way down. TORMUND Eh. Crows keep telling me I’ll get used to it. A few NIGHT’S WATCHMEN are up here as well. Tormund hears a strange sound, getting louder. He looks down to the north side of the Wall. Beric looks as well.  EXT. EASTWATCH, NORTH SIDE OF THE WALL  Emerging from the frozen coastal forest, the ARMY OF THE DEAD comes in force. All of them, 100,000 strong, with hundreds of WHITE WALKER officer corps on their dead horses.  EXT. EASTWATCH, TOP OF THE WALL - DAY  One of the Night’s Watchmen runs to the large horn and blasts three times.  EXT. EASTWATCH, NORTH SIDE OF THE WALL  The Army of the Dead halts in the no-man’s-land between the forest and the Wall, the Walkers on their dead horses in front of the wight foot soldiers.

But then a stranger sound comes from the north. Tormund looks to the sky, and sees a mote on the horizon, coming in fast. Very fast. It's moving so fast we don't get a clear look at it or the NIGHT KING on its back before it is upon us...  EXT. EASTWATCH, NORTH SIDE OF THE WALL  ...hitting the Wall with a blast of blue flame. Bran's meaningful birds take flight. A massive chunk of the Wall breaks free ahead of Tormund. The ice dragon glides away, and we get our first clear look at him, and at the Night King on his back. He's done the same thing to Viserion that he did to Craster's sons. Only those were babies, and this is a dragon.  EXT. EASTWATCH, TOP OF THE WALL - DAY  TORMUND (shouting a command) Run! Run! Tormund and Beric lead their wildling comrades to the stairs carved in the ice -- Eastwatch has a massive zig-zag stairway, not an elevator like Castle Black. They run for their lives and disappear from view.  EXT. EASTWATCH, NORTH SIDE OF THE WALL  The Night King and his dragon circle back, coming in for the kill. Hovering near the base of the Wall, the ice dragon shoots forth a steady stream of blue fire, thick as a tree trunk, strafing back and forth along the base of the Wall. The Wall cannot withstand the fire.   Thunderously, it begins to give way, sending pieces falling into the sea like a calving iceberg. CONTINUED: (CONTINUED)  GAME OF THRONES   \"The Dragon and the Wolf\"   61 . We see a few Wildling stragglers who didn’t make it down in time fall hundreds of feet to their death. The ice dragon keeps blasting until a huge breach has been opened, one large enough to admit the Army of the Dead, all 100,000 of them. And the White Walkers. And the Night King, flying low over their heads, into the camera -- -- and away from it. All of them heading south, for the world of men.  END OF SEASON 7  CONTI",
