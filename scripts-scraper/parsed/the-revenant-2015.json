Henry throws a glance back to Fitzgerald, bringing up the rear with Anderson. HENRY Fitzgerald's just testing you. Same with me since we left St. Louis.   Not sure I've passed many so far.   Especially today's. (beat) Maybe I should’ve had us make camp further up river. GLASS The tracks I saw... those ‘Ree had been on us for a while. They’d have gone as far north as it took. Henry nods... hopes that’s true. GLASS (cont’d) You’re a good man, Captain.   Soon as you realize that, these others will too. Henry likes hearing that... still isn’t sure it’s true. HENRY It's a different world than Boston. But my father... he thought this would be good for me. Henry thinks about that a beat, then shakes away the memory. HENRY (cont'd) Where are you from originally? GLASS Pennsylvania. HENRY Long way from home. A BEAT, then... GLASS Stopped bein' a home for me a while back.

I figured it was to kill me, but turned out they were just curious. Nothin' savage about 'em. I ended up stayin' with 'em a year or so. Till the 'Ree took their land... pushed 'em north. HENRY And you've just wandered alone since? GLASS Haven't found a place I belong. Another quiet beat, then... HENRY How much experience have you had with the Arikara? GLASS Enough to know to stay outta their way.   And that once they've got your scent, they're not easy to shake loose. HENRY And our chances of makin' it up to Fort Union?

And that's the problem. EXT. WOODS - DAY Glass moves slowly through the brush, almost gliding... subtle twists and turns to avoid branches and leaves... careful not to leave his scent behind.   And his eyes cut through the trees as he moves... digging for any sign of movement. He spots something at his feet... crouches down, running his finger over the SMALL ANIMAL TRACK in the dirt. O.S.

HENRY Have the men gather wood, but make sure it’s dry.   We don’t want much smoke when we cook that grizzly. EXT. WOODS - NIGHT And what’s left of the grizzly... its fur cut away... slabs of flesh butchered from its skeleton. A fire burns at the center of camp... a chunk of meat roasts above the flame.   The men sit around the fire... Murphy reaches up... tears a strip of meat from the roast, tossing it in his mouth.   The men are silent... the pall of Glass’ attack still hanging over them.

Glass pulls some snow from his horse’s mane... tosses it in the air, and watches it blow to the side. Glass turns his horse toward the breeze... squints out into the night. GLASS (cont’d) No more than mile out that way. (pulls his rifle) I’ll head in from the west... you take the east. HENRY What if it’s ‘Ree? GLASS Then we leave ‘em be... meet back up here. Henry nods... Glass takes off at a trot.   Henry veers the other direction... splitting up across the snow. EXT. FOREST - NIGHT Splinters of moonlight shoot through the pines.   Glass on horseback, walking through the trees... appearing and disappearing. He spots something in the distance... the slightest of glows. Glass eases off his horse... wraps the reins around a branch. EXT. WILDERNESS - NIGHT Henry’s already off his horse... leading it through the trees... searching as he walks.  93.",

His eyes shine in the darkness, drifting back and forth... picking up everything. He reaches the glow... the remains of a campfire.   The slightest bit of dying smoke rises into the air.   Glass crouches down, studying the surround ground... HOOF-PRINTS blended in with the other tracks. EXT. WILDERNESS - NIGHT Henry’s horse is making too much noise with each step.   He stops walking... wraps the reins around a tree... walks back around the horse... ...AND THERE’S FITZGERALD STARING AT HIM... Glass’ Anstadt aimed and ready to fire. FITZGERALD Didn’t figure an important man like yourself to be away from your stove on a night as cold as this, Captain.   You lost? Henry just stares back at Fitzgerald and that rifle.   His eyes drift to his own rifle, still strapped onto his saddle. HENRY I’m here to save your life. FITZGERALD Is that right?   Well I done told you boys... I don’t need savin’ by nobody. Henry knows he’s only got one chance... he makes a grab for the rifle. EXT. FOREST - NIGHT Glass running his fingers across the tracks.   Suddenly an O.S. GUNSHOT EXPLODES IN THE DISTANCE.   Glass spins to it... races back through the trees toward his horse.  94.",

WILDERNESS - NIGHT Glass charges from the forest... spots Henry’s horse standing in the trees... tears through the snow toward it... leaps off the still-moving animal in a fluid slide... hits the ground with his rifle ready... ...and sees HENRY’S BODY face-up in the snow. Glass drops to a knee... scans the darkness, as he slides over to Henry... ...and we see he’s a bloody mess... a GUNSHOT WOUND in his chest leaking out onto the snow... HIS HEAD SCALPED... LEFT EAR SLICED OFF. GLASS You shouldn’t a come. As Glass looks at Henry, he notices something... takes Henry by the chin, and tilts his head.   And HENRY’S RIGHT EAR HAS BEEN CUT OFF AS WELL. SPOTTED HORSE (V.O.) He say Arikara take right ear of Sioux.   Left ear of whites. Glass looks up from Henry's corpse... squints out into the forest. EXT. WILDERNESS/CLEARING - NIGHT Glass on horseback, leading Henry’s horse behind him across the snow-covered meadow.   Henry’s fur-covered body is draped over the saddle. EXT. FROZEN RIVER - NIGHT A thick layer of ice covers the narrow river, thinning just a bit at the center.   Glass kneels near the middle, chopping at the thick ice to get to the water beneath.   He makes a hole... dips his canteen down into it, glancing around into the darkness. Then Glass turns... stares up a slope into the dark forest beyond... like he knows what’s waiting for him there.  95.",

Glass SNAPS A BRANCH FROM A FALLEN TREE... looks back up that slope. EXT. WILDERNESS - NIGHT OUR POV FROM DEEP IN THE FOREST... ...watching from a low angle in the shadowy brush, as Glass appears up over the distant slope... riding through the trees, with Henry draped over the horse behind. The forest is quiet... just the CRACKING of crusty snow and branches under the horses’ hooves. Then BOOM... as the ANSTADT BARREL WE HADN’T SEEN BESIDE US FLASHES IN THE NIGHT... ...and Glass tumbles off his horse. The horses prance around nervously, then settle... and then FITZGERALD RISES FROM THE BRUSH BESIDE US... eases toward the horses, reloading the Anstadt as he moves. He reaches Glass, face down in the snow... his furs covering him. And Fitzgerald has that rifle aimed, ready for Glass to suddenly roll over firing... ...but Glass doesn’t move.   Fitzgerald nudges him with his boot, then rolls him over... ...and instead of Glass, we see HENRY’S LIFELESS FACE HIDDEN BENEATH THE FURS... and that BROKEN BRANCH sticking up along his back. ANGLE FROM BEHIND HENRY’S HORSE... ...on the REST OF THE BRANCH RIGGED TO GLASS’ SADDLE to hold Henry upright... ...and then what we thought was Henry flung over the second horse... MOVING... the bloody fur-covered arm lifting a rifle... the head rising up... it’s GLASS... taking aim... ...as Fitzgerald realizes what’s happened... spins with the Anstadt...  96. ...to Glass laying across the horse... rifle dead set on Fitzgerald... BOOM... BOOM... both rifles explode... ...Fitzgerald goes flying backward into the brush. Fitzgerald’s wild shot hits Henry’s horse, sending it rearing up, tossing Glass to the ground. But Glass is on his feet in a flash... reloading as he charges into the brush... ...but FITZGERALD IS GONE. Until the flash of movement behind Glass... he turns... as the butt of the Anstadt whips",
