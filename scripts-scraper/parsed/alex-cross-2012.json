TUNNEL -- CONTINUOUS 5   5 Cross drops down into the small brick-arched passage and resumes the chase.  INT. PACKARD FACTORY -- CONTINUOUS 6   6 As McGuire emerges from an opening in the floor. As he races to one end of the block-long space he finds Tommy entered from outside and Cross emerging from the tunnel behind him. He changes course, the reunited cops in pursuit.  INT. PACKARD PLANT 7   7 The chase continues through areas that border on the macabre: Some windows have old automobiles dangling half-way out. There are boats stacked all over the place, mountains of trashed TV sets, old RVs... Cross and Tommy run, and we by now are getting the sense they’re not so much chasing McGuire as channeling him, maneuvering him into a corner.  INT. PACKARD PLANT ELEVATOR SHAFT 8   8 McGuire skids to a stop. The shaft is three stories -- it appears he’s dead ended. But with the two cops closing in, he JUMPS, grabs iron pipes that run the length of the shaft, and SPRINGS UPWARDS from one pipe to another. Cross and Tommy continue on to THE AUTO RAMP at the building’s end.  EXT. ROOF, PACKARD PLANT -- DAY 9   9 McGuire emerges only to find Cross and Tommy blitzing towards him. The cops DIVE FOR COVER as McGuire whips out his pistol and FIRES 10 ROUNDS at them. McGuire then leaps off the roof, roll-landing 15 feet below on THE ROOF OF A CROSSWALK TO ANOTHER BUILDING.  2.

Instead he throws himself at a rusted ladder that descends to the crosswalk -- the force tears the ladder loose from the wall, LEVERING CROSS DOWN to the midpoint of the crosswalk as McGuire drops through a hole INTO THE CROSSWALK itself. Tommy, meanwhile, dangle drops to the crosswalk. He runs, drops through the hole --  INT. CROSSWALK -- CONTINUOUS 10   10 -- and is surprised to see Cross has stopped running. TOMMY What gives? CROSS Why are we chasing this knuckle dragger if he’s shooting at us? Cross draws out his pistol. It’s old school and bad-ass: a Ruger Super Redhawk .454  INT. PACKARD PLANT -- CONTINUOUS 11   11 McGuire senses he’s no longer being chased. He pauses -- his sight-line shows him Cross with pistol leveled, but not at him. He’s confused. Until he looks where Cross is aiming -- and sees TWO MASSIVE STAINLESS STEEL TANKS a hundred yards away. They’re labeled: N02. Before he can shut his jaw --  INT. CROSSWALK -- CONTINUOUS  TOMMY Good question. Cross quick fires six rounds at the two tanks.  INT. PACKARD PLANT -- CONTINUOUS 12   12 Cross’ shot triggers an ENORMOUS EXPLOSION, its ear-bursting shock wave blowing McGuire 20 feet back in the air, and smack landing him into a concrete pillar. McGuire comes to, and finds himself with a close up view of Cross’s Redhawk and Tommy’s Glock. CROSS Ian McGuire, your days of hurting little girls are at an end. Would you care to argue the point?  3. CONTINUED: 9   9 (CONTINUED) MCGUIRE How’d you keep up with me? TOMMY Because, dipshit, my daddy worked here -- CROSS -- and every weekend this was our turf. Cross hoists McGuire up. Onto his tippy toes. CROSS (CONT’D) Listen up. When you’re sitting in your 6 by 8 for the next fifty years, contemplate the irony: You got caught in our playground.  EXT.

The bookie checks his list. BOOKIE There is no Butcher of Sligo. SULLIVAN You're looking at him. The bookie eyeballs the white boy in his tailored suit and laughs his ass off. Sullivan grins back, shrugs off the jacket and loosens his tie. The Canton beauty glances in the bookie's direction. BOOKIE (subtitled Mandarin) Crazy gweilo wants to fight.   He bet $10,000 on himself. The Canton beauty nods her consent. Sullivan looks her way and nods.  9.",

Sullivan stands with his back to a brutish SERBIAN-AMERICAN with a roid-rage physique and prison tats. The bookie chalks up the odds, heavily favoring the Serb. Sullivan winks at a long-legged RING GIRL. SULLIVAN If I win, you're leaving with me. RING GIRL (smiling, coyly) What if I told you I'm only thirteen? SULLIVAN I'm not superstitious. The crowd simmers, on the verge of pandemonium as Sullivan turns and squares off with the enormous Serb. The blood- thirsty crowd forms a human barrier around them. The fight begins. Sullivan keeps his distance and studies the Serb. Recognizing a south paw, he circles to his right. The Serb reverses his stance. The brute is ambidextrous, and surprisingly athletic. He pops Sullivan with a fast left hook and a hard right. SULLIVAN (CONT'D) Not bad, Bluto.   I'm impressed. The Serb kicks Sullivan hard, then grapples him into a guillotine head lock and goes for the take down. SERB Anything goes, asshole! Sullivan sinks his teeth into his forearm. The Serb yells, releases and springs back. SULLIVAN I'm getting the hang of it. The Serb nails Sullivan with a devastating straight cross. Sullivan can definitely take a punch. The Serb pivots and strikes him with a swift kick to the thorax. Sullivan hits the dirt. The Serb's neck muscles tense, he takes a sharp intake of breath and leaps --  10. (CONTINUED)",

Sullivan grabs the brute's scalp and drives his knee into his face. The Serb wobbles, dazed and disoriented. Sullivan leans close to the Serb and whispers. SULLIVAN (CONT'D) Anything goes, right? Sullivan's entire demeanor shifts as if a switch is flipped in his brain. He launches an attack that is mind-blowing in its ferocity. No fancy martial art theatrics, just precision. The crowd erupts on the sidelines. The Serb flails wildly, crumples to the dirt and \"taps out\". The REFEREE glances at the boss. She signals the end of the fight. REFEREE (to Sullivan) We're done. Sullivan grabs a fallen betting slip and forces it down the Serb's throat. The referee tries to stop him. Sullivan shoves him away and delivers a devastating coup de grâce. The Serb's neck snaps with a stomach-churning CRACK. His body falls lifeless. SULLIVAN Now, we're done. Sullivan faces the crowd as torn betting slips rain down like confetti. He smiles and takes a bow from the waist. It's his trademark.  INT. LOCKER ROOM -- DAY 20   20 Sullivan listens to Led Zeppelin's Whole Lotta Love on earphones as he cleans up in a locker room (Sullivan listens to rock n' roll throughout our story.)

Flashlights cut the Stygian darkness and illuminate a POOL OF BLOOD. A DEAD CHINESE is sprawled on the floor. He's been shot between the eyes. A MACHINE PISTOL lies by his side. Dancing flashlights illuminate two more CHINESE gunned down. Both have sustained HEAD-SHOTS. Alex spots a SHOOTER, hunkered at the end of the hallway. The tactical team takes cover and levels their weapons. TEAM LEADER DROP YOUR WEAPON. Alex takes in the way the gunman is slouched against a heavy vault-like door. The tactical team prepares to fire -- ALEX Wait. Hold it. Don't shoot. The team leader bites back his frustration. TEAM LEADER What's the problem? ALEX Look around. These are professional hits. This guy's a victim. Which makes him a witness. Alex steps in front of Tactical before they can shoot. His body language is non-threatening, despite the fact that he's strapped and wearing Kevlar...The shooter raises his gun. ALEX (CONT'D) (calm; steady) Easy now. Easy. My name is Alex Cross. I'm a police detective... Just nod your head if you understand. Alex sees his face illuminated for the first time. His expression is full of anguish. Alex glances at the vault-like door open behind him. Suddenly the shooter jams the gun under his own chin, about to blow his head off. ALEX (CONT'D) You failed to protect someone.

He finds his resolve and tightens his grip on the gun.   Alex doesn't back off. ALEX (CONT'D) What happened here? CHINESE GUARD (weakly) No protect... The shooter drops his hand and draws something in his own blood. It's a CHINESE SYMBOL. The shooter raises his gun-and fires into his forehead. ALEX Ah, Jesus. The tactical unit converges and secures the area. Alex snaps on a pair of latex gloves. Then he reaches into the shooter's pocket. He pulls out slips of paper with blood on them. TOMMY What is it? ALEX Betting slips. TOMMY Looks like he lost.  INT. APARTMENT -- NIGHT 30   30 The tactical unit breaches the vault-like door and sweeps the apartment, which is surprisingly large and attractive. Alex and Tommy follow them into the expansive loft like space. Alex's flashlight illuminates the floor and walls spattered with more blood.
