She puts the cereal on the counter and walks through her cluttered apartment. Peeling paint, way too much stuff and years of stacked up New Yorker magazines. The small one bedroom apartment hasn’t been updated in at least 20 years: paint is chipping, furniture is worn and scratched by multiple cats, even the light bulbs need dusting. But you can tell it was once a well-loved little box of a home. The dining table is covered with papers and coffee cups and empty wine bottles, leaving little room for the manual typewriter and old computer. INT.
