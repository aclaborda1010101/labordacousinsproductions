You work hard, and you'll earn your share from the ground   up just like dad and all of us did - Marta I bet you agree with me. 49. LINDA Leave the poor girl alone. RICHARD No Marta do you agree, I'd like you to answer - you wanna become an American, there are legal ways to do it, but if   you break the law it doesn't matter if you have a good heart, you   gotta face the consequences. At   that moment booming shouts begin behind the study door - Harlan and Ransom going   at it.   Ransom bursts out. Marta   takes the opportunity to slip into the hallway, alone. She   breathes hard.   Takes a champagne flute from the tray. Drinks it in one gulp. INT.   LIVING ROOM - NIGHT END   FLASHBACK.   Marta in the same spot, Fran still talking her   ear off.   The ro",
