There's   a   deep plunging   stab   wound   between   her   breasts,   much   blood. Staggering   backwards,   Naz   knocks   the   light   over   again,   Andrea returning   to   silhouette   again. Blinking   furiously   he   turns   the   light   on   again,   confirms   what he   saw.   Turns   off   the   light. He's   gasping,   shivering,   in   shock.   Starts   wheezing asthmatically   but   can't   find   his   spray.
