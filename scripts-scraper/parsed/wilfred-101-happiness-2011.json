The   silence   is   shattered   when   a   big-ass   motorcycle  RUMBLES   down   the   back   alley,   rattling   the   bedroom   window.  Ryan   sits   up,   pissed.  EXT.   RYAN’S   BACK   YARD   -   MOMENTS   LATER   -   NIGHT  The   ROAR   of   the   bike   is   deafening.   Ryan   storms   across   his  meticulously   maintained   lawn   and   looks   over   his   back   fence.  RYAN’S   POV   -   ACROSS   THE   ALLEY  Fenced   yards   and   carports   line   the   alley.   SPENCER,   a   scary-  looking   dude   in   his   40’s,   sits   atop   his   idling   bike   in   his  carport.   He   removes   his   helmet,   glancing   in   Ryan’s   direction.  ANGLE   ON   RYAN  Ryan   quickly   ducks   down,   furious,   wishing   he   had   the   courage   to  say   something.   Spencer   cuts   the   engine   and   the   roar   abruptly  quiets,   allowing   Ryan   to   hear   the   shouting   of   an   (o.s.)   irate  neighbor   with   an   Australian   accent.  MAN’S   VOICE  Fuck   me,   that’s   loud!   It’s   the  middle   of   the   bloody   night!  DOLLY   ZOOM   ON   RYAN.   His   expression   suggests   he’s   aware   this  is   a   significant   moment   in   his   life,   even   if   he   doesn’t   yet  understand   why.   He   looks   in   the   direction   of   the   voice   and  realizes   it’s   coming   from   next   door.   Jenna’s   house.  JENNA   (O.S.)  Wilfred,   that’s   enough!  RYAN  (TO   HIMSELF)   Boyfriend.   Figures.  MAN’S   VOICE  You’re   lucky   I’m   indoors,   you   prick!  If   I   see   that   thing   on   the   street,  I’ll   punch   your   ass   into   your   face!  Jenna   appears   in   her   window   and   slides   it   closed.  JENNA  Stop   it!  MAN’S   VOICE  Christ!   You   know   how   long   it   took   me  to   get   comfortable?  Jenna   closes   the   blinds.   Ryan   waits,   but   the   yelling   stops.  He   heads   back   inside.

Then   his   fingers   begin   tapping   impatiently.   He   sits  up,   checks   the   clock.   It’s   1:25   am.   UPBEAT   MUSIC   kicks   in.  BEGIN   RYAN’S   SLEEPLESS   NIGHT   MONTAGE.  INT.   LIVING   ROOM   -   LATER   THAT   NIGHT  Ryan   is   on   his   laptop.   He   googles:   “How   long   does   it   take   to  overdose?”   He   studies   the   results,   then   checks   the   empty   pill  bottle   label.   This   should   be   working.   What   the   hell?  INT.   LIVING   ROOM   -   LATER   THAT   NIGHT  Ryan’s   on   the   couch,   watching   one   of   “THE   GODFATHER”   movies   on  cable.   He   glances   at   the   clock.   It’s   almost   3:00   am.   Why  isn’t   he   dead   yet?   He   is   seriously   annoyed.  INT.   SHOWER   -   LATER   THAT   NIGHT  Ryan   is   jerking   off.  INT.   LIVING   ROOM   -   DAY  Ryan   punches   a   key   on   his   laptop   and   walks   away.   The   printer  HUMS   to   life.  ANGLE   ON   LAPTOP   SCREEN  “Printing   ‘Suicide   Note   --   Fourth   Revised.doc’”  INT.   KITCHEN   -   LATER   THAT   NIGHT  The   clock   reads   4:20   am.   Ryan,   shirt   untucked,   tie   askew,  scrubs   the   counter,   furious   that   he’s   still   breathing.  END   OF   MONTAGE  INT.   BATHROOM   -   A   LITTLE   LATER  Ryan   looks   haggard   as   a   tweaker.   He   searches   the   medicine  cabinet   for   more   pills,   but   all   he   finds   is   a   half-full   bottle  of   cough   syrup.   He   downs   it,   grimacing   at   the   taste.  The   DOORBELL   RINGS.   He   checks   the   clock.   7:30   AM.   He   pulls  back   the   blackout   curtains.   Blinding   sunlight.   Unfortunate.  INT.   FRONT   DOOR   -   MOMENTS   LATER  Ryan   opens   the   door,   surprised   to   see   Jenna.   She   looks  frazzled   and   sports   a   canvas   bag   slung   over   her   shoulder.  JENNA  Hi--   Whoa!  She   reacts   to   his   appearance.   He   tries   to   fix   his   hair.  WILFRED   \"Pilot\"   3/26/10   3.",

I’ve   been   meaning   to   come  over   and   introduce   myself   but   people  don’t   really   do   that,   do   they?  RYAN  No,   it’s   kind   of   awkward.  JENNA  It   is.   (THEN)   This   is.   (THEN)   Can   I  get   you   something?   Orange   juice?  Medical   attention?  RYAN  I’m   okay.   Just   lack   of   sleep.  JENNA  Oh   god,   I   know,   that   stupid   jerk   and  his   motorcycle.   It   drives   Wilfred  nuts.   Sorry   about   all   the   noise   he  made,   by   the   way.  RYAN  Hey,   he   just   said   what   we   were   all  thinking,   right?  He   smiles.   Jenna   smiles,   confused.  JENNA  I   guess.   (THEN)   Look,   I   know   we   just  met   and   this   is   a   huge   imposition,   but  I’m   totally   desperate.   The  exterminator   is   on   his   way   and   I  forgot   to   make   arrangements   for   my...  ANGLE   ON   RYAN.   JENNA’S   VOICE   FADES   to   a   distant   echo,   drowned  out   by   the   HEARTBEAT   in   Ryan’s   ears.   He’s   staring   past   Jenna.  RYAN’S   POV  On   the   front   walk   is   a   man   with   thick   stubble   and   a   blackened  nose.   He   wears   a   very   cheap   dog   suit   and   stands   with   his   arms  crossed,   staring   implacably   at   Ryan.   This   is   WILFRED.  ANGLE   ON   RYAN,   nonplussed.   (We   no   longer   hear   the   heartbeat.)  JENNA   (CONT’D)  ...so   would   you   mind   if   he   stayed   in  your   yard   til   I   get   home   from   work?  WILFRED   \"Pilot\"   3/26/10   4. RYAN  (SNAPPING   OUT   OF   IT)   Huh?  JENNA  (MISREADING   HIS   HESITANCY)   You’re  right,   it’s   too   much   to   ask--  RYAN  No,   it’s   not   that--  JENNA  Great!   (CALLING)   Wilfred!   C’mere,  boy!   (TO   RYAN)   He’s   really   sweet.  Wilfred   goes   to   Jenna,   who   rubs   his   tumm",
