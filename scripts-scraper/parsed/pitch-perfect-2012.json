JOHN This is exactly the type of performance you would expect to see at “The International Championship of Collegiate A Cappella.”   Isn’t that right, Gail? GAIL John, you’re so right that everything else seems wrong.   This is what the ICCA’s are all about. ANGLE ON:   The Barden Treblemakers.   The guys are crushing it. JOHN (O.C.) The Barden University Treblemakers never disappoint.   It is their showbotage that is re-defining modern a cappella.   And the ladies, well, they just can’t get enough. GAIL Yes.   Nothing makes a girl feel more like a woman than a man who sings like a boy. A TREBLE steps forward to solo the next lyric. TREBLE SOLOIST I WANNA TAKE YOU AWAY. On the word, “Away”, he goes flat. GAIL/JOHN Whoa!/Boom! JOHN That was flatter than my ex-wife’s chest.   The Asian one. [get alts] INT.

ALICE (CONT’D) I can’t believe the Bellas are in the hands of you two slut bags after we graduate. Alice gets right up in Aubrey’s face.

Hard work, Gail.   When it comes to the technical aspects of the performance, they never falter. Plus they are   very   good looking. ALICE IT’S ENOUGH, ENOUGH. BELLAS OO-OOOOOH! ALICE IT’S ENOUGH TO KNOW THAT I... “The Sign” rendition has lulled the audience into a coma-like state.   One JUDGE even yawns. GAIL (O.S.)
