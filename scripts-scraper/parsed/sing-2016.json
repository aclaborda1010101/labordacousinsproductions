Tilt down from twinkling stars to reveal the most beautiful old  theatre in a street heaving with life...  ...But   not   human life. This is a city inhabited entirely by  animals.  We glide under the illuminated marquee and through the doors into  a grand foyer, where the very last patrons hurry to their seats...  INT. THEATRE - CONTINUOUS 2   2  The ornate house lights dim... Voices hushed.  The music starts. The orchestra is loud and dramatic.  BACKSTAGE: A lever is pulled... A sandbag drops from the  rafters...  STAGE MANAGER  Places, everyone!  A stage light turns on and points towards the stage. A MONKEY  stands in the wings and pulls tightly on a rope. The Curtain  opens, revealing a stage set resembling an enchanted wood.  FROM THE WINGS we see the back of a FEMALE SHEEP (NANA  NOODLEMAN) in a stunning purple dress and a tiara waiting to  go on stage. STAGE HANDS adjust the train of her gown.  Nana’s shoulders rise and fall as she takes a last breath  before stepping out.  As NANA raises her face into the spotlight she sings “Golden  Slumbers” by the Beatles.  NANA  ONCE THERE WAS A WAY TO GET BACK  HOMEWARD. ONCE THERE WAS A WAY TO GET  BACK HOME SLEEP PRETTY DARLING DO NOT  CRY. AND I WILL SING A LULLABY ...

MOON THEATRE FOYER - DAY 3   3  CLOSE UP: Young adult BUSTER and his FATHER.  We pull back to reveal Buster about to cut a ribbon in the  theatre foyer. His FATHER stands proudly next to him and a  photo is taken - freezing the action in a PHOTO.  BUSTER (V.O.)  Some folks may have said he grew up to  be the greatest showman this city has  ever seen, some called him a visionary,  a maverick...  The camera continues to pull wider to reveal the PHOTO hangs on a  wall amongst posters for   theatre   productions.  BUSTER (V.O.)  Sure, some folks said he was as crazy as  he was stubborn, but I say “Wonder and  magic don’t come easy pal.” And oh,  there would never be any doubt...  At the base of this wall of photos we find Buster sat in a  chair facing his posters. He spins around and talks into  camera.  BUSTER (V.O.)  The name Buster Moon would go down in  entertainment history. And I should  know, because I am Buster --  ANGRY CHIMPANZEE (O.S.)  --Moon! Open this door!  Sing   2. It’s the present day, the action is now live and Buster is  startled as if waking from a dream.  THE SECRETARY: MISS CRAWLY - a   spectacularly doddery old   lizard  with one glass eye - enters through a connecting office door.  MISS CRAWLY  Good morning, Mr. Moon.  BUSTER  Miss Crawly, what uh...what’s going on?  MISS CRAWLY  You gotta lot of animals waiting to see  you, Mr. Moon.  BUSTER  I do?

REPORTER (ON TV)  Um yeah, Buster Moon certainly  brought down the house once and for  all today. And although Mr. Moon  has not been available for  questions, unconfirmed reports  suggest he   was   responsible for  building a water tank that exploded  and flooded the building. I’ve been  told the 250 squid who had been  part of Moon’s display are in fact  employees of 3-star restaurant Les  Calamars, and that none of them  were harmed during the incident.  Whether they will be returning to  their usual work is not yet--  There is a   1-2-3 KNOCK . It’s coming from the poolhouse doors,  but the blinds are drawn.  BUSTER  (Drowsy)  Eddie? There’s someone at the door.  Eddie   snores .   Another 1-2-3 KNOCK   turns Buster’s head to see  the distinctive SILHOUETTES OF THE CAST AGAINST THE WINDOW.  Buster turns the TV off.  BUSTER (CONT’D)  (To Himself)  Oh no.  MISS CRAWLY (O.S.)  Mr. Moon?  Buster stands - concerned there will be conflict.  ASH (O.S.)  Come on, Moon. You can’t just hide  out in your buddy’s pool house.  ROSITA (O.S.)  Yeah, we just wanted to make sure  you’re alright, that’s all.  Buster sheepishly opens the door.

BUSTER  No. None of this is okay.  ASH  At least we’re all in one piece.  ROSITA  Yeah, and you know what, I bet we  can find some other place to   put  the show on. Right?  They all agree.  BUSTER  The   show ? Guys, I’m done.  JOHNNY  Are you serious?  ASH  Whaddya mean ‘done’? Come on!  Buster lifts a crumpled newspaper from the floor: He’s  headline news.  BUSTER  Didn’t you see this? Huh? Look, it  says I am a “danger to society...”  GUNTER  Bah!  BUSTER  “...
