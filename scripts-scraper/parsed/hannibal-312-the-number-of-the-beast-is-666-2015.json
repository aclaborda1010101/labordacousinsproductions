HANNIBAL Thank you, Frederick. DR. CHILTON I just finished reading your most- recent piece.   Extraordinary stuff. HANNIBAL It's a particularly good one. DR. CHILTON It, uh... it may be my favorite. I've seen a lot of hostility.   But this was quantifiably bitchy.   Do you think I'm your nemesis? HANNIBAL No.   Nemesis?   No. DR. CHILTON You refuted my entire book. HANNIBAL It didn't hold up to scrutiny. Chilton inclines his chin, goes on the offensive. DR. CHILTON Of course it didn't, I was lying. On your behalf.   To save your life. You refuted your insanity defense. I went out on a limb for you and you went up there and sawed it off. HANNIBAL \"Wood burns because it has the proper stuff in it; and a man becomes famous because he has the proper stuff in him.\"   You don't have the proper stuff, Frederick. DR. CHILTON I'm a best-selling author.   The journals only still publish you for the freak value of your byline. A mercenary smile as Chilton relishes his next words.

I think I'll call it   The Dragon Slayer .   All I need is the ending. Hannibal smiles -- not the reaction Chilton hoped to evoke. HANNIBAL Fate has a habit of not letting us choose our own endings, Frederick. DR. CHILTON This is the ending fate has chosen for you.   Your teeth will go and your strength.   Nobody will be afraid of you anymore.   After Dr. Bloom's reign, you'll be out in the ward.   The young ones will push you around and use you for sex.   All you'll get to read is what you write on the wall.   You've seen the old ones.   They cry when they don't like the stewed apricots. Dr. Chilton stares for just a moment longer, then fishes a copy of   Hannibal the Cannibal   from his briefcase on the floor. DR. CHILTON (CONT’D) I'm just going to leave an extra copy of my book right over here. I've personalized the inside cover. Chilton places the book on the table by the doors as they BUZZ open.   He takes one last glance over his shoulder to see Hannibal is still watching him even as the doors close. INT. BSHCI - CELL BLOCK - DAY Chilton straightens his jacket, glancing up to see Alana Bloom leaning against the far wall. DR. CHILTON Are you here to remonstrate me with \"I told you so\"s?

The door opens and Dolarhyde stands there, taking her in. REBA MCCLANE I don't like surprises.   I bet you don't, either.   I tried to call you. (then) May I come in?   I won't be long.   I asked my taxi to wait. INT. DOLARHYDE'S HOUSE - FOYER - NIGHT Dolarhyde closes the door behind Reba as she stands in the foyer.   Reba takes in familiar elements of the house -- the TICKING of a large clock looms loud in her ears. REBA MCCLANE How're you feeling? A nasal whisper from the mask pressing against Dolarhyde's nose: FRANCIS DOLARHYDE Okay. REBA MCCLANE Your office said you were sick. FRANCIS DOLARHYDE The flu.   You shouldn't be here. REBA MCCLANE I brought you soup. She walks toward the living room.   Comfortable in this space now.   Following the sound of the music.   Dolarhyde follows... INT.

      "action_text": "That small admission takes a weight off Reba's shoulders. Chilton's eyes flick from Reba to Dolarhyde and back, trying desperately to read their dynamic, holding his breath. REBA MCCLANE I've learned that withdrawal can be a strategy to avoid pain. (then) I have a deep vein of cripple's anger in me; while I can't get rid of it, I've made it work for me. It's fueled my independence and strengthened my determination to wring all I can from every day. Dolarhyde looks to Chilton -- and steps closer to Reba.   Not intimate, but threatening, as Dolarhyde's bulk trembles, trying to maintain control. REBA MCCLANE (CONT’D) I'm not so scarred by life that I'm incapable of love.   I hope you aren't, either.   Enjoy the soup. Reba turns and exits.   Dolarhyde follows her to the door.   ON CHILTON silently watching a possible savior leave the room.

A tranquil winter night interrupted by -- A SHIFTING, FLUTTERING ORANGE LIGHT Coming fast down the street.   The beacon is seen to be flames engulfing a wheelchair and its occupant -- Chilton. The rolling conflagration and its victim roar past CAMERA, headed directly toward -- THE CITY FOUNTAIN At the street's junction.

Blinding light blasts through a projector lens. Behind it, the celluloid ratchets past as the lamp hits it. CLOSE ON the curved glass of the lens as an image is reflected in it -- Frederick Chilton secured to the wheelchair. CUT TO: EXTREME CLOSE-UPS: Chilton's bandaged face as liquid cascades over it.   His coughs and gags, his eyes scrunched tightly shut, tell us it is gasoline. The fuel drips from the wooden wheelchair's arms.   Its wheels. CLOSE ON the flare of a match combusting, coming to life.

Behind him, a projector screen is silently playing footage Dolarhyde filmed of Molly and WALTER at Will's cabin. Will stares, but says nothing.   Chilton is frightened as he speaks, taking pains to stick to the Dragon's script: DR. CHILTON (on screen) I have had a great privilege.   I have seen with wonder and awe the strength of the Great Red Dragon. I lied about Him.   All that was said was lies from Will Graham.   He made me say them.   I have blasphemed against the Dragon.
