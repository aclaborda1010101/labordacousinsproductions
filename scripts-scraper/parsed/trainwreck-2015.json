GORDON You like your doll, right? You love your doll. KIM Yeah. GORDON You love the doll. But what if I told you that was the only doll you were allowed to play with the rest of your life? How would you feel? KIM Sad. GORDON You’d feel sad of course because there’s a lot of other dolls on your shelf. And if you play with the other dolls you can’t have that doll anymore. Even though that doll doesn’t really want to play with you at this point. You’re both living a lie. There’s other dolls you like and they’re making new dolls every year. You want a stewardess doll?
