REAL SPENCER INTERVIEW SET UP THE REAL SPENCER REINHARD is revealed sat in a voice-over booth reading from a script before looking into camera REAL SPENCER ...this is me, Spencer Reinhard – these are my words and this is my story. CUT TO A SHOT OF A CLOCK - THE KIND YOU MIGHT FIND IN A PUBLIC LIBRARY - SLOW CREEP IN - THE SECOND HAND TICKING SOFTLY INT. BATHROOM - DAY Paraphernalia strewn around a sink - tweezers, glue, makeup, a pair of glasses, a fake beard, a prosthetic nose - we hear cutting and short clumps of hair fall into the sink. A blue contact lens covers up a brown iris. We pick up details of an intricate process progressing in silence. INT. REAL PRINCIPAL’S OFFICE, SCHOOL. DAY Interview setup with THE REAL PRINCIPAL of LEXINGTON CATHOLIC HIGH speaking just off-camera. REAL PRINCIPAL These were good kids, good students from good families. It was a truly shocking moment when we found out. I felt certain there’d been a mix-up – they played on the soccer team. Hell, I would have had ‘em babysit my grandsons. INT. BEDROOM - DAY A man is packing a duffle bag - edgy - we see what looks like a pair of leather gloves go in - then zip ties, a tazer, a rubber mask with the face of George Bush - the bag is zipped shut. INT. SPENCER’S PARENTS’ HOME, INTERVIEW SETUP - DAY Spencer's real parents are sitting together on the sofa – holding hands. This is not a subject they are happy talking about. INTERVIEWER(O.S) Can you explain what it is that you feel concerned about?  2",

GARAGE - DAY Close on furtive hands with a power screwdriver removing car license plates and replacing them with others. CLOSER ON THE CLOCK - SECONDS TICKING INT. BATHROOM - DAY The disguise process is advancing - we snatch details of two old men stood in front of a mirror dressed formally - one is dying his eyebrows grey whilst the other applies glue to his nose.

CAPTION:   THE REAL SPENCER REINHARD  REAL SPENCER If you asked me would I do it all over again – I would say no. No, I wouldn't - not because I regret doing what we did - but to save my family from the pain I caused them...  3",

REAL SPENCER (V.O.) ...the pain we all caused everyone. INT. HALLWAY/LIVING ROOM - DAY A fourth man with a bald head is pacing back and forth jangling a set of car keys in his right hand - he checks his watch, his hand is shaking - he looks in the hall mirror and straightens his tie, breathes in, closes his eyes for a breath before briskly opening the front door and walking out. INT. BEDROOM - DAY Kubrick’s The Killing plays on an old TV. The man with the duffle bag is now sat beside it on the end of a neatly made bed - waiting/fidgeting. He is wearing sunglasses and an ill- fitting suit that looks like it belongs to another time and another person. He checks his watch, shifts uncomfortably. INT. BATHROOM - DAY Actor Spencer and Actor Warren both unconvincingly disguised as old men assess themselves one last time and then each other. They are sweating, not a word is spoken between them. They leave the bathroom for a bedroom where two sports jackets are laid out on the bed - one brown, one yellow. They put them on in silence, one puts on sunglasses, they turn to face each other making eye contact for the first time. ACTOR WARREN Ready? ACTOR SPENCER In body. EVEN CLOSER IN ON THE CLOCK - ticking getting louder INT. BEDROOM - DAY The man with the duffle bag checks his watch, pulls out a cross hanging from a silver necklace around his neck, kisses it, puts it back, grabs the bag, hits the off button on the TV and stands to walk out.  4",

As they turn to go we follow them around the side of the van and track behind them to reveal that they are heading toward an imposing mock-colonial building on the other side of an open quad which is clearly part of a school campus. We follow them across the quad toward the steps - it’s a strange moment - we feel the rush of blood pumping in our ears, off-speed, noises are distorted, everything a little off - a feeling of dissociation. Students look straight at them/us aware that they are out of place.

Standing beside them are the ACTIVES (Senior Frat boys) stationed every couple of meters. NEW PLEDGERS (singing in unison) Jump down, turn around pick a bale a cotton. Jump down turn around pick a bale a day. LEAD ACTIVE Louder Niggers! I can’t hear you! NEW PLEDGERS I’m gonna get on my knees and pick a bale a cotton, Get on my knees and pick a bale a day... The NEW PLEDGES shuffle along singing until the LEAD ACTIVE blasts a claxon at which point they stop and are forced to turn to the Actives who surround them with hose pipes protruding from their zippers like cocks connected to beer funnels that they hold above their heads. The recruits nearest the Actives have to suck on the hose pipes until the beer is drained from the funnel - the last to finish (ACTOR ERIC)is then made to step out of the line, drop his trousers and perform a deeply humiliating action while the singing continues. REAL ERIC (V.O.) Why did I volunteer for ritual humiliation? (laughs) Because it’s what I was programmed to do.

He gazes at the ceiling and releases a plume of smoke from his mouth that engulfs the camera. Yves Montand crackles on a record player in the background.

His POV to reveal that he is most of the way through an impressive pointillist rendering of a strip mall. He takes another drag, assesses it for a beat before picking up a jar of filthy paint water and throwing the contents in disgust (with both himself and his work) at the painting/camera.

ACTOR ERIC It’s a bit like that scene in A Beautiful Mind - only that guy was a genius. ACTOR WARREN Yeah well it has a logic to me. ACTOR ERIC I cannot wait to hear it. EXT. DORM BLOCK ROOF - NIGHT Eric and Spencer are lying on their stomachs overlooking the library. Eric is looking through the binoculars, behind him Warren is walking precariously around the roof ledge like a tightrope walker. REAL SPENCER (V.O.) Eric got sucked in same as we were. He wanted to go back to the beginning, he needed to see it all for himself - look at him, all of sudden he’s Robert fucking DeNiro in Heat.  59",

Even if we could figure out how to kill the bell on the alarm itself, it’s probably connected into a central security hub. ACTOR SPENCER Central security hub? Spencer and Warren exchange a look. Warren climbs down, gets out his notebook and starts to write. ACTOR ERIC There’ll be a safety department office for the entire campus - that’s where they’ll be monitoring all the CCTV, the alarms and motion sensors and shit - Wait. (noticing Warren) What are you doing? ACTOR WARREN I’m taking notes - you know, minutes. ACTOR ERIC Are you fucking retarded? Why don’t you fax the FBI and ask where they’d like us to leave fingerprints... INT. WARREN INTERVIEW SETUP REAL WARREN I was grateful for Eric’s input - he has a real head for logistics but as I saw it this was my deal.

DORM BLOCK ROOF - NIGHT ACTOR ERIC (still looking through the binos) It can’t be done at night. It’s the one time when no-one is supposed to be in the building so it’ll be almost impossible to get in - we have to do it when the library’s open. How many cameras did you say were in the special collections room? ACTOR SPENCER Two that I could see. ACTOR ERIC So we need to find out who’s watching, when and for how long. ACTOR WARREN OK good. I would concur with that. Spence you need to get inside the Safety Department Office and see who’s got eyes on the library. Eric rolls his eyes.

BUNGALOW - DAY Warren is leaving the house - he becomes aware of a gardener on the opposite side of the street, a bin man, a man in a passing car - all of whom, in his mind, seem to be watching him. He breaks into a run. INT. REAL SPENCER INTERVIEW SET UP REAL SPENCER Hard to describe that feeling. When you know you’re on borrowed time, things are suddenly put in perspective.... INT. REINHARD FAMILY HOME, DINNER TABLE Spencer sits at the dinner table surrounded by his family - they are laughing and eating and chinking glasses - something being celebrated, Spencer is tipsy and seemingly overcome with love for his family.

SUPERMARKET - NIGHT Tinny elevator music - row upon row of product - endless iterations of the same thing in different packaging. We reveal this to be Warren’s POV. - he is perusing almost deserted supermarket aisles without purpose - he wheels an empty trolly through a technicolor corridor of breakfast cereal. INT. REINHARD FAMILY HOME, FRONT DOOR - LATER Dinner’s over, Spencer is leaving. MR REINHARD Sure you’re alright to drive Spence? You had a couple. MRS. REINHARD (O.S.) Honey, stay the night if you need to. ACTOR SPENCER Nah, I got a big day tomorrow. I love you guys - I’ll see you soon. He gives his dad an overly long hug and walks out the door. INT. SUPERMARKET - NIGHT Warren is placing some objects in his shopping trolley - quintessentially American junk food, cheese wizz, hot pockets, a ‘hungry man’ ready meal proudly advertising its contents ‘a full pound of food’. He opens the frozen meals freezer, pulls out a box of Chicken Alfredo, scans the ingredients - his POV - a litany of e-numbers, xantham gum, msg and stabilizers. He looks around before stashing it under his coat. INT. SPENCER’S ACURA LEGEND - NIGHT Snow has begun to fall - Spencer is at the wheel. As he drives we see his POV - the snow lit up by his headlights, falling harder now - hard to see too far ahead - reminiscent of a year ago. Angle on Spencer driving - suddenly he closes his eyes.  121",

SUPERMARKET - NIGHT Warren pushes his shopping trolley down an empty aisle of the supermarket then shoves it and watches it drift away on its own - he turns and walks past the cashiers toward the exit clutching the stolen ready meal under his coat. As he nears the exit he hears: MALE VOICE (O.S.) Excuse me sir. Sir. Stop - stop right there. INT. SPENCER’S ACURA LEGEND - NIGHT Spencer, eyes closed and speeding into the snowy night - we hear the revving of the engine - finally his eyes snap open but too late - he smashes violently into the back of a car waiting at traffic lights. INT. SUPERMARKET - NIGHT Warren begins to run. He turns to throw the ready meal at the pursuing security guard who bats it away and tackles him just as he gets outside the automatic doors of the store. Warren, pinned to the snowy ground looks into camera. INT. CHAS’ BEDROOM - NIGHT Eric bursts in on Chas who startles and reaches for the gun that he has on the desk, fumbles it and sends it flying across the desk and out of the open window. ACTOR ERIC Warren’s been arrested and I can’t reach Spencer. We need to get out of here. ACTOR CHAS Fuck. Fuck. Where are we going to go? ACTOR ERIC Canada, we should go to Canada. I have a cousin there. Chas is already up and throwing clothes into a rucksack. ACTOR CHAS You serious? I was thinking more along the lines of a motel. ACTOR ERIC We could get on a bus tonight. ACTOR CHAS Go pack your shit then.  122",

They tiptoe out of the room and edge slowly down the stairs where they can clearly hear that there’s someone downstairs. Chas picks up a dumbbell and puts on an American football helmet and Eric grabs a walking stick as they go tentatively from room to room in relative darkness. The sound is coming from the basement, Warren’s den. They edge toward it. As they reach the bottom of the stairs they can see the place has been ransacked - or has it? - they turn the corner and come face to face with Warren - they all jump out of their skin. ACTOR WARREN Fuck, you scared the shit out of me. ACTOR ERIC I heard you’d been arrested. ACTOR WARREN Yeah, it was a misunderstanding - they let me go. ACTOR CHAS What do you mean? What did they arrest you for Warren? INT. REAL CHAS INTERVIEW SET UP. REAL CHAS Something wasn’t right. Besides Warren being a fucking idiot. You don’t bust someone for shoplifting then just let them walk free - that didn’t sit right. Same with Spencer, he totals his car and they just let him walk home? It didn’t add up. INT. WARREN’S DEN - NIGHT Warren sits in bed reading The Rum Diary by the light of a lava-lamp. We hear what he’s reading in V.O. ACTOR WARREN (V.O.) “Tell them it’s fear of the sack. Tell them this man is fleeing St Louis because he suspects the sack is coming down on him and it’s full of something ugly...  123",

REAL SPENCER INTERVIEW SET UP Real Spencer looks calmly into the camera, silent. ACTOR WARREN (V.O.) ...this man is not a model youth. He grew up with two toilets and a football... INT. ERIC’S BEDROOM - NIGHT. Eric is propped up in bed attempting to stay awake but slowly dropping off. ACTOR WARREN (V.O.) ...but somewhere along the line he got warped. Now all he wants is Out, Flee... INT. REAL ERIC INTERVIEW SETUP Eric looks calmly into the camera saying nothing. ACTOR WARREN (V.O.) ...and he doesn’t give a good shit for St. Louis or his friends or his family or anything else...

WARREN’S DEN - NIGHT Warren is dropping off - his eyes closing slowly... ACTOR WARREN (V.O.) (drowsily) some place where he can breathe...

BUNGALOW - FRONT DOOR - NIGHT The splintering of wood as the front door bursts open followed by torchlight and shouting raking the interior of the house as the FBI flood through doors and windows. The action slows to slo-mo and slower still - sync-sound drops away as Offenbach’s Barcarolle (or the like) swells and we see the boys awaken rudely to the reality of what’s happening around them. Eric attempts to climb out his window onto the roof where he is met with spotlights and threats to lie down with his hands on his head, Chas reaches for his gun and finds himself at the top of the stairs facing a screaming FBI agent pointing a shotgun at him. Another housemate and his girlfriend awake naked, terrified and bewildered. At Transy campus Spencer’s dorm is raided - he sits up in bed with a look of mild relief on his face. Warren awakes in the basement where beams of white torch light pierce the floorboards. He sits up in bed and listens to the mayhem above - then lies back down. We are high and wide pushing in on Warren as he stares calmly up at us until he is finally found - lit up by torchlight and then dragged roughly from frame. BLACK. We see REAL NEWS ARCHIVE from the arrest. REAL SPENCER (V.O.) What is fear? Fear is an emotion designed to protect you from harm. It makes you avoid danger, prevents you making a silly mistake and getting eaten by a bear or some shit. INT. REAL SPENCER INTERVIEW SET UP REAL SPENCER But like Darwin said - it’s an emotion most of us don’t run into a whole lot - not real fear anyway. The kind a caveman might have had to deal with. So we look for new ways to experience something like it... As per the opening - we are driving through suburban Lexington everything green, genteel and placid. Old men prune hedges, a kid bounces soundlessly on a trampoline... the same images we saw in the opening montage. REAL SPENCER (CONT’D) ...to feel like we’re really alive.  125",

UNKNOWN LOCATION - DAY We pull back from the shot we have seen repeatedly as the anonymous hands fill a last remaining white space with a small point of coloured pigment transferred from a piece of coloured magazine page. Slowly we pull back and out to reveal that we are hovering above an artist in prison overalls who is at work on the floor of a prison cell where he has created a huge pointillist image made up hundreds of thousands of dots of colour on dozens of sheets of A4 paper and slowly the image becomes clear to us. It’s a vivid, exceptional and very different rendering of John James Audubons Heron - the one Spencer met on the highway. Angle on the artist taking in his work - it’s Actor Spencer, older with a long beard and long hair - a long long way from the kid we first met. REAL SPENCER (V.O.) There have been many times when I’ve wondered how it’s possible that we went through with it. How all the pieces fell into place... Angle Spencer’s POV - the painted face of Warren. INT. REAL SPENCER INTERVIEW SET UP REAL SPENCER I’ve never said this to Warren but I’m not sure whether the memory I have of the guy I saw in the park that day... EXT. BRYANT PARK, NEW YORK - FLASHBACK - DAY The scene from Spencer’s POV of the man with the scarf and pony tail - reverse on Spencer - his POV - suddenly it’s the man with the white hair that Warren described - reverse on Spencer again frowning slightly - his POV again and there’s no one there just Warren waiting by the hot dog stand. REAL SPENCER (V.O.) ...is a memory of a guy I saw, or a memory of a guy Warren told me I saw. And I bet if you ask Eric or Chas they’ve probably wondered, as I have, if Warren ever really did go to Amsterdam? EXT. LEXINGTON AIRPORT DEPARTURES - FLASHBACK - DAY We see Warren hugging Spencer goodbye as we did before - he walks off into the airport and the camera cranes up to the upper level - arrivals - where Warren emerges and jumps in a taxi.  126",

AMSTERDAM CAFE - FLASHBACK - DAY Warren enters the cafe where he met the shady dealers - he looks around but this time they’re not there. He sits down, fires up a joint and orders pancakes. REAL SPENCER (V.O.) For all I know Warren sent those e-mails to himself. INT. REAL ERIC INTERVIEW SETUP REAL ERIC Yeah, I guess I have at times wondered if any of that was true. Ha!(laughs) But I know Warren, and he will stick to his story until the day he dies. INT. REAL WARREN INTERVIEW SET UP We see what seems like b-roll from Warren’s interview - as lovable, mischievous and unknowable as ever. REAL SPENCER (V.O.) And you know what? It doesn’t even matter anyway if there never was a buyer for the books. INT. REAL SPENCER INTERVIEW SET UP REAL SPENCER I probably   would   do it again. Not because I don’t feel terrible about what we did to our parents or that poor lady... WE SEE REAL FOOTAGE AND PHOTOS OF THE BOYS PRE-HEIST, Gradually growing up - good, wholesome kids, preppy and conservative, we see shots of their REAL high school graduation. REAL SPENCER (V.O.) ...or that I don’t wish I hadn’t spent 7 years of my youth in jail and destroyed my future. (beat) REAL SPENCER (IN VISION) I didn’t want that future.  127 WE SEE REAL PHOTOS OF THEM TAKEN IN PRISON - SHOCKING AND UNRECOGNIZABLE - THEY ARE IN RAGS, WITH LONG HAIR AND LONG BEARDS - SURVIVORS OF A SHIPWRECK. INT. SPENCER’S PARENTS’ HOME - INTERVIEW SETUP Spencer's real parents are sat together on the sofa – holding hands - as per the beginnng. REAL SPENCER’S DAD What we went through I can best describe as grief. I don’t think the sentencing was fair at all. They were children. Girls mature faster. Boys are still children at that age. What more proof do you need than this? INT. REAL ERIC INTERVIEW SETUP REAL ERIC You’ll probably consider this bullshit - it doesn’t matter to me either way. But jail was the best thing that",
