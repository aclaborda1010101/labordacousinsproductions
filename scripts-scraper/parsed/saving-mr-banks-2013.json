(singing)  Winds in the East  Mist coming in--  FADE IN:  A whoosh of wind spins us around in a blue sky, spinning,  spinning until we slow to a stop and find ourselves amongst  white fluffy clouds. A shadow (oddly shaped like an umbrella)  dances amongst the nimbus.  TRAVERS (V.O.)  --Like something is brewing,  about to begin--  The shadow’s direction becomes purposeful - taking us down  through the clouds, whipping us on the wind towards a small  town in the distance.  TRAVERS (V.O.)  --Can't put me finger on what lies  in store--  Downwards and downwards until it skittishly circles a large,  bustling park and then swoops us into the lavish gardens.  There, a ten-year-old girl plays in the lush grass; she puts  the finishing touches to a miniature version of the large  park she sits in - benches made from twigs, trees from  flowers, picnic cups from acorns - and gives a satisfied nod.  She wraps her arms tightly around her chest, lifts her face  to the sky, a half-smile threatening to break across her  concentrated face. This is the young P.L. TRAVERS (whom we  will also know as GINTY.)  TRAVERS (V.O.)  --But I feel what's to happen, all  happened before--  Her little brow is furrowed with imagination and then, all of  a sudden, the smile breaks free as something in her mind  becomes real.  INT. SHAWFIELD ST - PAMELA’S OFFICE - LONDON - MORNING (1961)  P.L. TRAVERS sits in her rocking chair (in the same position  as above) arms clasped tightly around her body, face to the  sky. Older, beautiful; striking blue eyes aid her air of  stiff and steely determination.",

Buddha  smiles from every corner, framed poetry and letters adorn the  walls alongside pictures of Pamela throughout the years with  men we will not come to know and everywhere, china hens sit  on shelves, their wings clasped to their chests, brooding.  Despite the multitude of objects, the room is peaceful,  white.  Downstairs the doorbell rings.  Pamela closes her eyes, breathes.  It rings again, Pamela shakes her head, tuts. She stands up,  smooths down her skirt with flat palms. Breathes.  INT. SHAWFIELD ST - DOWNSTAIRS HALLWAY - MORNING  Pamela opens the front door and squints as a flood of  sunlight and cherry blossom petals float over the threshold.  DIARMUID RUSSELL (45) - bright, youthful - waits to be asked  inside. Pamela is not pleased to see him.  DIARMUID  Mrs Travers.  INT.

PAMELA  With all due respect Mr Russell I  am on very good terms with my own  faculty and exceedingly confident  in its decision making  capabilities.  Diarmuid’s shoulders visibly sag, he lets out a long  frustrated breath.  DIARMUID  You made an agreement. Do you  understand? A verbal agreement.

LAX - ARRIVALS - DAY  A bleary eyed Pamela carries her two bags into the arrivals  area. She’s immediately hit by dazzling sunlight and a sea of  signs bearing the names of various passengers and companies:  she scans Paramount, Warner Brothers, MGM, finally falling  upon her own name - P.L.

There, huddled together, whispering are her mother,  the doctor and Aunt Ellie.  Ellie is holding a pile of blood stained sheets.  Ginty stands frozen, trying to still the panicked beating of  her heart.  Margaret spies Ginty and moves towards her as if in slo-mo.  There are flecks of blood on her dress. She is ashen,  shattered. She comes down to Ginty’s level.  MARGARET  Daddy--  Ginty cannot react.  Margaret sweeps her into her arms and Ginty drops the brown  paper bag; it tears and scatters pears all over the floor.  Ginty’s eyes fix on Aunt Ellie’s umbrella on the back of the  chair, drawn into its beady black eyes.  GINTY  I want to see my father.  MARGARET  No, you mustn’t.  GINTY  I want to see him!  Suddenly she turns into a wildcat - lashing, thrashing,  biting, screaming. Nothing will stop her seeing Travers.  AUNT ELLIE  Let her go Margaret.  Margaret is forced to let go and Ginty runs for her father’s  bedroom.  INT. TRAVERS’ BEDROOM - DAY  Ginty stands in the bedroom, a long way from the bed.   She  stands there, it seems, for an eternity. Then, finally, step  by step she draws closer. The empty bottle on the floor. The  sheets twisted, still wet with sweat, flecked and spotted  with blood. The front of her father’s nightdress is also  bloodstained. Ginty’s eyes reach his face. Travers lies, eyes  open, mouth open, teeth slightly red-stained, neither  peaceful nor distressed. Just-- nothing.",

SHAWFIELD STREET - LONDON - DAY  Pamela moves through the vestibule, lugging her suitcase.  PAMELA  Hello house.  INT. PAMELA’S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT  Pamela sits in a chair in the living room watching in  darkness. She gently closes her eyes, ringed with sadness and  a lifetime’s despair.  There’s a knock at the door and she jolts awake, she doesn’t  know how long she’s been asleep but it’s black outside. She  gets up and rushes to the door as quickly as her feet will  take her.  She swings it open.  PAMELA  Oh dear god!  Standing on the doorstep is Walt Disney. Pamela is, quite  literally, speechless.  WALT  It was one heck of a job getting a  seat on the very next flight, let  me tell you. PAMELA  But, you always get what you want  eventually. Isn’t that right  Walter?  He looks down at her hand clenched into a fist and shaking.  WALT  How about you show me how to make  one of those nice English   pots   of  tea?  INT. PAMELA’S DRAWING ROOM - NIGHT  Pamela sits at the table, as Disney carries in a tray with a  teapot, a milk jug, a sugar bowl and two cups. These he  places on the table and proceeds to pour tea.  PAMELA  Milk. The milk goes in first.  He attends to it.  WALT  I remember.  PAMELA  And whiskey. I’ll have whiskey in  mine.  Disney follows her gesture to the whiskey decanter. She takes  it from him and pours a generous slug into her teacup.  WALT  (surprised)  Oh.   (beat)  Oh well, when in Rome!  He pours a slug into his tea too.  PAMELA  You’ve come to change my mind. To  beat me into submission.  WALT  No, I’ve come because you misj",
