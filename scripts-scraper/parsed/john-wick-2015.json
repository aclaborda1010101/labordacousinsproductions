THE WICK HOME - THE KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS  John unceremoniously tosses the newspaper onto the table,  opens a cupboard, and measures out a couple of tablespoons of  Folgers Coffee into an old percolator.  As it begins to bubble, John open the fridge, studies its  contents for a moment or two, and then closes it, abandoning  the thought of breakfast.  He pours himself a cup of coffee and sits at the table.   The  newspaper is ignored.   He drinks in silence for a long, dark,  brooding moment, the loneliness almost unsettling.  Suddenly, the phone on the wall RINGS.  John lowers his cup, staring at the device, his eyes tired.  A beat... and he stands, walking slowly to answer it.  JOHN  This is John.  As he listens to the voice on the other end, John remains  still... stoic.  JOHN (CONT’D)  (whispers)  Ok.  John hangs up the phone and returns to the table, sinking  slowly down into his chair.  A long beat...  ...and John begins to weep, his hands trembling as he lowers  his face in excruciating, utter, and complete sorrow.  FADE TO:  EXT. THE BARN - ESTABLISHING - DAY  Having shaved and showered, wearing an old -but well-fitted-  gray suit, John pushes open the garage door...  ...to reveal a legend in dire need of a total overhaul: a  black, 1969 FORD MUSTANG ‘BOSS 429’.  2.",

      "action_text": "A smile plays at his lips as John walks into the garage,  running a hand along the chassis, desperately in need of a  wash and wax.   Behind him, the wall is lined with tools:   a  mechanic’s dream enclave.  John enters-  INT. JOHN’S CAR - CONTINUOUS  -and closes the door behind him.  John takes a moment to breath it in:   he loves this car...  although he hasn’t taken very good care of it as of late.   A  beat... and he slips the key into the ignition, twisting it,  the motor coughing to life, the exhaust pipe belching black  smoke.  EXT. THE WICK HOME - CONTINUOUS  The vehicle pulls out of the garage, stalls briefly, come  back to life, puttering on down the road.  EXT. THE HOSPITAL - ESTABLISHING - DAY  A soft rain begins to fall.  INT. THE HOSPITAL - A HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS  Carrying a humble bouquet of yellow daisies, John slowly  makes his way down the eerily empty corridor. He pauses  before a picture on the wall, glancing at his reflection upon  the glass. He takes a deep breath, exhales, and enters a  room.  INT. THE HOSPITAL - A ROOM - CONTINUOUS  John slowly approaches the figure lying in bed: surrounded by  machinery, accompanied by the soft sounds of technology.  He removes the wilted daisies from the vase, tosses them in  the trash, and replaces them with fresh ones.  He pulls over a chair, reaches out, and takes Norma’s hand:  she is comatose, her breathing synthetic... so many  machines... so many wires, tubes, and monitors.  We never see her face:   just her silhouette.  He holds her hand for a long moment in heavy silence.  3. Behind him, the DOCTOR -of a similar age to John- enters,  placing a hand on John’s shoulder. John lowers his head, and  nods.   With a bit of effort, he stands, staring down at her  for a long moment, never once releasing his grip, and leans  over to kiss her on the forehead.  JOHN  ...it had to be you...  (a long beat, then)  ...be seein’ ya’...  A beat... and John nods.  The doctor turns off the machine; lights dim, the roo",

THE WICK HOME - THE BASEMENT - DAY  Unlike the rest of the house, this space is pristine and  organized: one half designated as an impressive wood shop,  the other an office space with a lazy boy recliner and tube  television.  John sits at his desk with a pencil in hand, a pad of paper  before him, thinking.  A long beat... and he sighs with a smile, placing the pencil  upon the pad before sliding them both aside.  John unscrews the cap off the bottle of scotch and pours  himself a healthy dose.  He opens his desk drawer, reaches into the back, and finds an  old pack of cigarettes, half-empty.   He taps one from, places  it between his lips, and lights it, taking a deep pull. He  holds it, and exhales, his body relaxing.  He finishes his drink along with the cigarette, pours himself  another...  ...and then opens a BOTTLE OF PILLS (The label reading NORMA  WICK and OXYCONTIN), pouring them into a small mound upon the  desk.   He stares at them for a long moment...  ...before selecting one, studying it, sighing and-  A KNOCK AT THE FRONT DOOR.  John freezes, not sure as to how best to proceed.  A beat... and someone KNOCKS a second time.  John sighs, drops the pill back onto the mound, and walks  upstairs.  EXT. THE WICK HOME - DAY  A DELIVERY WOMAN waits for him on the doorstep.

DELIVERY WOMAN (CONT’D)  Have a good day.  John nods, and -as she takes off- heads back inside.  INT. THE WICK HOME - THE LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS  John closing the door behind him...  ...and is startled by a small BARK.  A beat... and he looks down to find that he is actually  holding a small PET CARRIER.   He lifts it to look inside:  the face of a young, tri-colored (black, white, and brown),  CHORGI (half-Corgi, half-Chihuahua) looks out at him, her  tail wagging fiercely.  She barks again, and John lowers it, confused.  INT. THE WICK HOME - THE KITCHEN - DAY  Holding the envelope in his hands, John sits across from the  carrier which he has set upon the table.   Inside, the Chorgi  lies with paws crossed, studying him, tilting her head from  side to side.  A beat... and John opens the letter.   The card inside is  simple; white with a single DAISY drawn upon it. John smiles,  instantly knowing who it is from, running a thumb along the  face of the flower.   He hesitates, but opens the card.  6. NORMA (V.O.)  Dear, John.   If you have received  this, then I have not survived the  surgery.  (a beat, then)  I am so, so sorry.  Tears begin to well in John’s eyes.  NORMA (V.O.)  But you’ve still got a life ahead  of you, and I intend for you to  live it.   You may think you’ve  hidden things from me, but you  haven’t.   I know you.   And should  this reach you in time -which I  pray it has- I beg you, I implore  you, to stop.   To think.   To live.  (a beat, then)  I love you, John.   With all my  heart.   Our years were good.   The  best, in fact.   But I’d rather see  you later... than sooner... your  best friend... Norma.  John lowers the letter, wipes ",
