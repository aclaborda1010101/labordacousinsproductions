Rachel’s underpants are the kind you’d find in a twelve-pack: moss green cotton bikinis with lots of little flowers.   The elastic waistband is separating in one spot. MAN (O.S.) Are you ready? RACHEL Uh-huh.   Yeah. Rachel fluffs up a pillow and plants her face in it. (muffled) I’m ready. MAN (O.S.) Alrightie... Like a sun rising over a mountain, RICHARD GRIMES, mid- forties, in boxers and a faded T-shirt, appears above the curve of Rachel’s hip.   He sits up on his knees behind her and after a considered pause, pulls Rachel’s underwear down. RICHARD Just breathe, okay? (a beat) Are you breathing? RACHEL (muffled and annoyed) Yes!   Go! RICHARD Okay. Richard lays one hand on her haunch and with the other raises a SYRINGE with a LARGE NEEDLE.   He nervously takes aim -- One... two... three. -- and spears the needle into his wife’s flesh. RACHEL Owww!   Fuck!   Richard! RICHARD What?!   RACHEL (CONT'D) That fucking hurts!

Still holding the syringe, Richard uses his teeth to open a SMALL FOIL ENVELOPE, causing him to slur -- RICHARD Uhm shorry, honey.   I did ekshactly what the nursh told me to do. He spits out the torn-off strip, removes an ALCOHOL PAD and presses it over the injection site just as TWO RESCUE DOGS, ENO and LAZLO, click into the room and hop up on the bed. RACHEL (pointing) Wasn’t it supposed to be more like here? RICHARD Nope.   Upper outer quadrant . RACHEL Then why did it hurt like that? Nobody on the message boards said it’s supposed to hurt like that. RICHARD I don’t know, Rache.   It’s a bigger needle.   Maybe you have a lower pain threshold than most people.   I don’t know.   I’m not a doctor. Remember? Rachel watches Richard as he climbs off the bed and drops the used syringe in a PLASTIC WATER BOTTLE that already contains a dozen others.   This new, larger one, lands with a dull CLUNK. RACHEL Are you mad at me? RICHARD No.   I’m not mad.   I’m just... Whatever.   I don’t know.   Tired.

CHARLIE I’m serious.   What would you say if they were a gay male couple who wanted to start a family and Sadie wanted to help them? CYNTHIA I’d say... mazel tov, now go get some girl off the internet and leave us out of it.   Sadie doesn’t realize what it is she’s doing. She’s just... throwing her genetic material around like it’s... popcorn.   Auctioning off family property like it’s no big deal. CHARLIE (almost to himself) They are our family. CYNTHIA What? CHARLIE Richard and Rachel are our family. The words hang there.   Then, Charlie notices something on his wife’s face.   He reaches over to remove it and Cynthia rears back. CYNTHIA What! CHARLIE You’ve got something on your chin. Cynthia turns away and grabs at her chin to discover an errant piece of toilet paper. CYNTHIA It’s nothing.   It’s just... 77 CHARLIE It’s bleeding. She touches her chin with the back of her hand and sees a little red smear. CYNTHIA It’s just... a thing.   A pimple. It’s fine.   My god. Charlie watches his high-strung wife grab tissues and press them against her chin. CHARLOTTE (O.S.) I got into Berkeley. The couple turn to see their daughter holding a letter. CYNTHIA What? CHARLOTTE My early decision letter came.   I got in. Charlie jumps out of bed and gives Charlotte a congratulatory hug.   Cynthia’s eyes well up. CHARLIE That’s great, honey.   We are so proud of you.   Isn’t it great, Cyn? Cynthia is caught in a swirl of confused emotions, but she manages a smile. CYNTHIA Yes.   It is.   It’s great, honey. I’m so happy for you... Charlotte smiles, then notices something. CHARLOTTE What happened to your face, mom? CYNTHIA Oh.   It’s... fine.   It’s just... -- but it’s not fine.   The damn b",

RACHEL (ON PHONE, PRE-LAP)  Sadie Barrett has applied to become a donor in the Conceptions Oocyte Donor Program.  INT. PICKLE GUY PRODUCTION FACILITY - DAY  Richard’s cellphone is on speaker-mode as he and Sadie listen. RACHEL (ON PHONE)  The purpose of this evaluation is to assess her appropriateness as a donor and to gain insight into her psychological and emotional well- being...  INT. RACHEL AND RICHARD’S APARTMENT - DAY  Rachel paces and reads into her phone.   INTERCUT.  Psychological testing indicates that all clinical scales are within normal limits.... no significant evidence of psychopathology.  Sadie does a fist pump and hoots.   Richard gives a thumbs up. Okay, here’s the good part:   Ms. Barrett presented as a bright, sophisticated and charismatic young woman --  Sadie beams and curtsies.  -- who appears comfortable with her decision to donate.   She is mature and intelligent and it is likely that she will comply with the medical demands of the donation... In conclusion, Ms. Barrett is approved as a candidate for oocyte donation.  Richard raises his hand.   Sadie gives him a high-five.  INT. IL BUCCO ALIMENTARI - DAY  Cynthia, stunned, sits across from her daughter. CYNTHIA You passed? 79",

SADIE I don’t have a mental health history... dad does. CYNTHIA It is genetic, you know. SADIE Okay.   Fine.   I have some depression and anxiety.   Maybe a little OCD, but the normal amount that everybody has. A WAITER arrives. WAITER Can I take your order? SADIE I’ll have the kale salad with a Zoloft to start and a side of Klonopin. Unfazed, the waiter just stares at Sadie who smiles and hands him her menu.   Cynthia shakes her head, amused, then hands over her own menu. CYNTHIA The risotto, please. The waiter leaves. SADIE Oh, and, by the way, I talked to Dad and he’s fine with it. CYNTHIA He is? SADIE Totally.   He said he thought it was a wonderful thing to do for two people I love.   He’s proud of me. Cynthia’s throat tightens. 80 CYNTHIA Well, he always has been a big believer in spreading genetic material around without putting much thought into the consequences. Sadie looks away and sighs. I’m sorry.   I’m sorry. She lays her hand on her daughter’s and looks her in the eye. You know, I love you, right? Sadie nods, but not right away. And even though I don’t agree with you, at all -- I respect you.   And if this...   project   is something you feel that you have to do, then... you should do it. SADIE So you’re cool with it? CYNTHIA No, I’m not cool with... anything. Ever.   But I see how much this means to you and I don’t want to stand in your way.   I want to... to support you... no matter what. SADIE You do? Cynthia nods.   Mother and daughter smile at each other, tears brimming in their eyes.   Then -- CYNTHIA It doesn’t mean I’m happy about it.  INT. RACHEL AND RICHARD’S APARTMENT - KITCHEN - DAY  A BIG BOX is sliced open to reveal a CORNUCOPIA OF FERTILITY MEDICATION AND SUPPLIES: vials, syringes, needles, a red plastic sharps container...

How’s it going? SADIE Good.   How are you? SAM Good. Sadie points awkwardly toward the unisex stalls. SADIE I need to -- Sam steps out of the way.   Sadie enters a stall and shuts the door.   Sam stands there for a moment, nervously holding the full tea kettle. SAM Sadie? SADIE (O.S.) Huh. SAM Are you freaking out? SADIE (O.S.) Uh.   No.   Not really.   Should I be? SAM I was just wondering.   Because that happens with people sometimes. They get... intimate with someone and then, you know, they spaz. SADIE (O.S.) I’m not spazzing.   Are you? SAM No. SADIE (O.S.) Cool. SAM Cool.   What about Richard?   Was he freaked out? 101",

(amused) Well, there’s nothing to be concerned about.   Everyone involved is pretty evolved. SAM You just seem kind of distant. SADIE (O.S.) I’m in the bathroom. SAM I mean the other morning.   You left before I woke up. SADIE (O.S.) Oh, yeah.   Sorry.   I was late for something.   I’m not trying to be coy or anything... As Sam listens, he realizes he can see -- A SLIVER OF SADIE through the edge of the stall door.   She places a syringe between her teeth and wipes her belly with an alcohol swab. SADIE (CONT’D) (slurring) It’s just, there’s a lot of personal shit I’m dealing with at the moment. Sam’s eyes widen and his jaw drops open as she expertly injects herself.  INT. RICHARD AND RACHEL’S APT - BEDROOM - NIGHT  Just like Rachel did when we first met her, Sadie lies on her side, surrounded by sheets and pillows.   She reads from a drug information sheet. SADIE “Human Chorionic Gonadotropin.” Jesus.   Could it sound more sci-fi. Rachel swabs Sadie’s haunch. 102 RACHEL They call it the trigger shot.   It makes you ovulate.   Then 36 hours later, the retrieval and...   finito . Richard appears with a large intramuscular needle. RICHARD Okay.   You ready? SADIE Yep. RICHARD Alrightie. He places one hand on Sadie, takes aim -- One... two... three. -- and spears the needle into her.   He pulls the plunger back to check for blood.   Then he pushes the plunger down. Almost done.   Almost done.   Almost done.   Done. Richard pulls the needle out.   Rachel presses a swab against the injection site and hands Sadie a bag of frozen peas.  LATER --  All three of them are lying in the bed, staring at the ceiling.   After a few seconds of silence -- RICHARD I guess it’s stating the obvious, but we couldn’t have done this without you. Sadie smiles. SADIE Oh, my god.   You know what we never even talked about? RACHEL What? SADIE The whole birthing",
