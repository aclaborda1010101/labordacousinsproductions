Her pace   is   slow   and   clumsy. We   don't   see   her   face,   but   her   legs   and   arms   are   completely covered   in   blood. At   a   clearing   in   the   woods,   she   stops.   Someone's   following her.   Two   shadows   dart   between   the   trees.   She   picks   up   her pace,   moving   faster   now. Suddenly,   out   of   the   dark,   someone   throws   a   black   hood   over her   head   and   yanks   her   back.   She   falls   to   the   ground.

Clothes   that   would normally   be   cute   and   endearing   now   bear   witness   to   horrible violence.  we   see   the   girl's   POV   through   the   hood.
