HIS POV - Across the room, Oleg and George eat dinner, drink wine. George CALLS OUT: GEORGE Tony! George waves him over. Lip joins them. LIP Shirley’ll be here in a minute. A WAITER approaches. BIRMINGHAM WAITER Cocktails, gentlemen? OLEG Three shots vodka. Tony looks at Oleg. OLEG (CONT’D) Last show. Cold war over. Time for truce. Lip nods, smiles. The Waiter leaves to get the drinks. GEORGE Is Shirley in his dressing room? LIP More like a broom closet. I don’t understand why he puts up with this shit. Oleg takes a sip of wine, glances at George. CONTINUED: (CONTINUED)  96. OLEG Six years ago, 1956, Nat King Cole was invited to perform at Municipal Auditorium right here in Birmingham. Mr. Cole was very first negro asked to play at a white establishment in this city. Lip butters a roll, takes a bite. OLEG (CONT’D) Soon as Mr. Cole started playing, a group of men attacked him for playing white people’s music. Pulled him off stage and beat him badly. Lip stops chewing. OLEG (CONT’D) You asked once why Dr. Shirley does this? I tell you. Because there is no genius without courage. The Waiter returns with the drinks. They CLINK glasses, down the shots. Lip NOTICES Shirley (now in his tux) and the MAITRE D’ having a conversation at the entrance. Lip walks over. LIP What’s the problem? DR. SHIRLEY This gentleman’s saying I can’t dine here. LIP (to Maitre D’) No, you don’t understand, this guy’s playing here tonight--he’s the main event. MAITRE D’ I’m sorry. It’s the policy of the restaurant. Graham Kindell, the congenial GM, joins them. GRAHAM KINDELL Everything all right? CONTINU",

SHIRLEY You hungry? CUT TO:  EXT. THE ORANGE BIRD - NIGHT - ESTABLISHING SHOT INT. THE ORANGE BIRD - NIGHT  This is a Blues Bar/Restaurant. Lip and Shirley ENTER. A small BAND in the corner--piano, drums and guitar--plays the BLUES. Lip’s the only white guy in here and he doesn’t go unnoticed, especially standing next to Shirley in a tuxedo. They make their way to the bar, sit. A female BARTENDER gives Lip the once-over. ORANGE BIRD BARTENDER You a cop? LIP I look Irish? She smirks. ORANGE BIRD BARTENDER What you want, baby? DR. SHIRLEY Two Cutty’s, neat. Shirley takes out a   BIG WAD OF CASH . A couple DRUNKS at the bar take notice. ORANGE BIRD BARTENDER Comin’ up. She grabs a bottle of Cutty, pours the drinks. DR. SHIRLEY Whatever your specialty is, we’ll take it. She CALLS back toward the kitchen: ORANGE BIRD BARTENDER Two orange birds! SMASH CUT:  102.",

You stood up for yourself. It’s like your friend the President says -- “Don’t ask what your country can do for you, ask what you can do for yourself.” Shirley smiles. The Bartender approaches. ORANGE BIRD BARTENDER (to Shirley) So, darlin’, what you do, all dressed up like that? He shrugs. DR. SHIRLEY Nothing important. LIP He’s only the greatest piano player in the world. She smiles. ORANGE BIRD BARTENDER That right? You good? LIP Don’t be shy, Doc. Tell her who you are. ORANGE BIRD BARTENDER Don’t tell me nothin’--show me. Shirley thinks a moment, glances at the BEAT-UP PIANO. He gets up, walks to the stage, sits at the piano. He notices a drink on the top of the piano. Shirley takes the drink, puts it on the floor.  SHIRLEY PLACES HIS HANDS ON THE KEYS, TAKES A MOMENT...  And then... Shirley starts to play. This isn’t a catchy jazz solo or a Christmas ditty. It is, instead, an explosion of sound, the eye-popping machinations of Chopin’s Etude Op. 25 No. 11, one of the most difficult piano solos ever written.  The crowd lower their forks and gaze up in disbelief. (CONTINUED)  103. ANGLE ON Lip watching this in awe. Black kitchen workers stop what they’re doing to watch. A COOK steps out of the kitchen, wiping his hands on his apron. BACK ON SHIRLEY as he negotiates the eight-finger chord combinations with the mastery of the maestro that he is.  He builds and builds and builds until his fingers become JUST A BLUR ON THE KEYS.  Shirley FINISHES, the room is quiet. Then the place   ERUPTS IN APPLAUSE!  CLOSE ON Lip. He’s as blown away as the audience. Shirley looks toward a stunned Lip and winks. The GUITAR PLAYER, DRUMMER, and SAX join Shirley on the stage. They start a cool up tempo rockin’ blues number. Shirley effortlessly joins in, taking the music to another level. The entire room begins to PULSATE. The",
