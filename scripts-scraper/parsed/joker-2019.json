ELEVATOR, APARTMENT BUILDING - CONTINUOUS 7   7 Joker steps onto the wheezing elevator, harsh fluorescent   * lights, graffiti on the walls. As the door closes, he hears--   * SOPHIE (OS) Wait!! He puts his foot out with some panache to stop the closing door-- He's a romantic at heart.   Ding.  And SOPHIE DUMOND (late 20's), tired eyes, hands filled with grocery bags, steps onto the elevator with GIGI, her 5-year- old daughter. SOPHIE Thank you. (realizing) Of course it’s you,-- everyone else in this building is just so fucking rude. Joker nods \"thanks.\" Holds his breath, hoping he doesn't start to laugh. Floors dinging as the elevator rises. Joker sees GiGi licking the dirty smudged elevator handrail behind her mom. SOPHIE How’s your mom doing? He takes a deep breath, he's uncomfortable talking to her, holds up the white prescription bag. JOKER It's day to day. I’m doing everything I can to get her back on her feet. (re: pharmacy bag) Picked up her medicine. Gonna make her some dinner. 9.",

Joker just nods... he doesn't know what to say, but clearly wants to continue this conversation with Sophie. The doors open. They all step off. SOPHIE Okay. Well, tell your mom I said hello. And Sophie and GiGi walk down the hall-- the opposite way of Joker. He just stands there for a beat. Heart beating fast. JOKER (calls out after her) Hey Sophie-- She turns around. JOKER I’ll tell my mom you said hello. She smiles as in \"yeah, that’s what I said.\"  INT. MOM'S APARTMENT, FRONT DOOR - EVENING 8   8 Old apartment, worn carpet. Nothing's new inside but it's fairly neat and well-kept. Joker closes the door behind him, leans his back against it and swoons. Hears a deep purring sound. He looks down and sees an OLD ORANGE CAT, rubbing up against his leg. Then-- 10. MOM (OS) (shattering the moment, calls out) Happy?! Did you check the mail before you came up? JOKER Yes, Ma. Nothing. No letter. MOM (OS) You sure you looked? Sometimes I don't know where your head is. Joker glances back down and sees the cat is gone. JOKER Yes I'm sure. And my head's right here. I’m gonna make you some dinner, okay? QUICK CUTS: JOKER TEARS OPEN THE PRESCRIPTION BAG... A FLURRY OF PILL BOTTLES TUMBLE OUT ONTO THE COUNTER.

RECEPTIONIST Oh, in that case, I'll buzz you right in. Joker goes to enter-- RECEPTIONIST I'm kidding. Leave it here. He laughs along with her, even though she's not laughing. JOKER Oh. Right-- well, my mom used to work for the Wayne family-- for 12 years. She was their housekeeper. A couple other business people are now waiting behind Joker, there for meetings. RECEPTIONIST That's great. But you can leave it with me or you can leave with the letter. Those are your options. Now please step aside. JOKER Mr. Wayne knows her.

He starts banging on the glass... but the group keeps moving. Not noticing him. RECEPTIONIST Sir. Please stop. Sir!! Joker keeps banging on the glass.  EXT. WAYNE TOWER, FRONT ENTRANCE - MORNING 13   13 The glass doors swing open and Joker is forcibly thrown onto the street. TWO LARGE SECURITY GUARDS stand over him. He is still holding the letter.

RANDALL (mid 50's), a big bear of a know-it-all, standing there. He's a party clown as well. He's half-dressed in his clown suit. 16. RANDALL I heard about the beat down you took. Fucking savages. JOKER It was just a bunch of kids. I should have left it alone. Randall opens his locker-- RANDALL It's crazy out there. And it's only getting worse. JOKER (nods) My mother says that the people nowadays lack empathy. RANDALL What's empathy? JOKER It means like \"feeling for other people.\" RANDALL Like sympathy? JOKER Kind of. But different.
