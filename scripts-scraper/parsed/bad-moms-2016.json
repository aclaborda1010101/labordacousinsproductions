      "slugline": "EXT. NORCHESTER, MASSACHUSETTS -- MORNING  Norchester is a beautiful, leafy suburb of Boston. Kids ride  bikes. Dads walk dogs. Neighbors chat with each other. And in  the middle of town sits  THE NORCHESTER SCHOOL  Surrounded by playgrounds and lush fields, Norchester is the  public school we all wish our kids could go to: dynamic  teachers, motivated students, winning sports teams, every  type of arts program imaginable -- it’s perfect.  A LINE OF MINIVANS DISGORGE HUNDREDS OF K-12 CHILDREN  in front of the school as WELL-DRESSED MOMS load up their  precocious KIDS with backpacks, lunchboxes, and science  projects before kissing them goodbye. Then  A TOTALLY BUSTED 1985 TOYOTA CELICA  thunders up to the school blasting HIP HOP and billowing GREY  SMOKE from its tailpipe. The car rumbles to a stop and a HUGE  15 YEAR OLD with a mullet and ripped jeans get out--  VOICE FROM THE CAR  Hey dum-dum you forgot your lunch!  A bag of McDONALD’S flies out of the car. The giant kid  catches the bag and shambles off towards the school. Finally  we reveal the MOM driving the Celica:  CARLA DUNKLER  She’s wearing a low cut silver lamé top, no bra, sunglasses,  and she couldn’t give a fuck. FREEZE FRAME on Carla lighting  up a cigarette as we smash the title over her face:  BAD MOMS  UNFREEZE as camera captures all of the other MOMS’ horrified  reactions to Carla. They shake their heads, disgusted...  CARLA JUST FLIPS THEM ALL THE BIRD  as she roars off down the street. The camera STAYS WITH the  beautiful, super-fit, super-rich alpha mom of the school  GWENDOLYN JAMES  as she watches Carla drive off. She turns to her two best  friends, VICKY LATROBE, not so bright, and MEAN STACY:",

GWENDOLYN  Because she’s one-sixteenth  Chickasaw Indian, and you can’t  fuck with that kind of diversity.  (scowling after Carla)  No, that bitch is   bulletproof ...  VICKY LATROBE  Couldn’t you find another Indian to  replace Carla?  GWENDOLYN  Vicky, I’m the President of the  PTA, I’m not Kevin fucking Costner,  okay? I can’t just blow my ram’s  horn and make more Indians appear.  Mean Stacy frowns at a CLUSTER OF MOMS nearby.  MEAN STACY  Oh gross look: all the Attachment  Moms are wearing harem pants today.  The ATTACHMENT MOMS, long hair, BABIES in slings, HIPPY KIDS  at their feet, walk up the path wearing baggy harem pants...  GWENDOLYN  Those bitches better vaccinate  their filthy children or I swear to  God I will go   off --  (waving sweetly to them)  Hey Meg! Hey Shar! Love your pants!  The ATTACHMENT MOMS wave back, friendly,   heyyy!  VICKY LATROBE  Uh-oh, the Tiger Moms are late  today.  Three anxious TIGER MOMS hurry their stressed CHILDREN up the  walk to the school, wheeling suitcases full of books.  MEAN STACY  Violin Camp must’ve run late this  morning.  2. GWENDOLYN  Look at their fucking kids. They  look like   hostages .  (smiling, to Tiger Moms)  Hey Karen call me!  ONE OF THE TIGER MOMS waves sweetly as she hurries past.  MEAN STACY  Oh God pretend to look at your  phones here comes that weird stay-  at-home mom.  A dorky stay-at-home mom, KIKI, approaches wearing a  cardigan, mom jeans, and a desperate smile. She herds TWO  SMALL KIDS and a pair of BABY TWINS. Gwendolyn’s crew quickly  looks at their phones, trying not to make eye contact, but  Kiki walks right up to them, barely holding it together:  KIKI  Hey guys how are you guys?!

Super-chill HIPSTERS exit past her.  MONOTONE HIPSTER  You have shit all over your jacket.  Amy peeks inside the conference room to see DALE shaking his  head at her as he talks to a co-worker.

AMY  It’s cool. This is just how I look  when I’m incredibly hungover...  Amy pulls a HOSTESS DING DONG out of a box and starts eating  it. Jane watches, worried.  DYLAN  Aren’t you going to make us  breakfast?  Amy looks at her kids, chewing, considering...  AMY  Yeah, no. I’m not gonna make your  meals anymore...

AMY  I don’t think that has anything to  do with her parents’ divorce.  JANE  No mom, that’s what happens! For  the rest of my life I’m going to  struggle with intimacy, and I’m  going to search for approval from  weird old men, and the odds of me  getting divorced just went up like  a thousand percent!

I  promise.  JANE  How do you know that?  AMY  Because I’m your mom and I know you  better than anyone in the world.  Jane frowns, comforted, sniffling back tears...  JANE  I just had my whole life worked out  so perfectly and now it’s...not  perfect anymore.  AMY  I know. I did too. But maybe life  is supposed to be messy, you know?  And maybe trying to make it perfect  is what messes everything up in the  first place...  Jane nods, dries her eyes, feeling a little better...

AMY’S BEDROOM -- LATER THAT NIGHT  Amy and Jessie collapse back on her bed, sweaty, exhausted,  post-coital. Amy smiles,   extremely   satisfied.  AMY  Mm, that was nice...  Jessie just stares at the ceiling, wide-eyed, his mind blown.  JESSIE  I don’t-- I can’t-- What was that  thing you did at the end?  AMY  I don’t know. I just came up with  it in the moment.  JESSIE  Honestly, that was by far the best  I’ve ever had.  AMY  Really? Aww...  Amy smiles, a bit proud. Jessie looks over at her, smitten:  JESSIE  I’ve never met a woman like you  before, Amy...  AMY  That’s because you’re very young  and you haven’t met a lot of people  yet. But thanks, you’re very sweet.  83. JESSIE  Can I go down on you again?  AMY  Ya! Sounds great!  Jessie grins and eagerly scoots downward...  CUT TO:  EXT. NORCHESTER SCHOOL -- LATER THAT NIGHT  It’s very late and the school is dark and empty and ominous.
