Looks at the house. The  front door remains closed. No Mia. He leans back. Seems  worried. Closes his eyes, breathes out. We MOVE CLOSE on him.  He   breathes in and out again...  He opens his eyes. 8:10. The door’s still closed. Resigned,  he starts his car up, BEGINS TO PULL AWAY, when --  --   BAM!   A KNOCK on the opposite window. He jumps.  It’s Mia. She’s just arrived at the car from the other side,  two just-bought cups of coffee and a bag of pastries in her  hands. A beat. Sebastian smiles. Then OPENS the door for her.  OMIT 123  EXT. PARAMOUNT STUDIO LOT - DAY 124  A cloudy late afternoon. Mia and Sebastian slowly walk  through the lot together. They pass the New York street, the  murals and posters of classic Hollywood, the old Art Deco  ornaments and the big soundstages and backdrops. Neither says  a word...  INT. WAITING LOBBY - DAY 125  Mia and Sebastian are seated. Waiting. The DOOR opens. An  ACTRESS exits. A second later --  ASSISTANT #2  Mia?  Mia gathers her nerves. Gets up. And steps in.  INT. AUDITION ROOM / INT. LOBBY - DAY 126  In the room is AMY BRANDT -- mid-forties. Seated behind her  is the director, FRANK.  AMY BRANDT  Hi, Mia.   MIA  Hi.  AMY BRANDT  I’m Amy, this is Frank. Glad we found you.  Mia nods. Smiles. A moment.  AMY BRANDT (CONT’D)  The movie shoots in Paris. There’s no script.  Revision   72.",

MIA  ...About...?  AMY BRANDT  About anything.  Mia nods again. A moment.  AMY BRANDT (CONT’D)  Whenever you’re ready.  Mia thinks. She takes a breath -- then goes silent again. It  seems she might be unsure what to do, might even be about to  choke the audition. We fear she may botch this completely...  WE CUT TO THE LOBBY -- to Sebastian, hearing Mia’s silence. On A126   edge... Worried...  WE RETURN to the AUDITION ROOM... Brandt and Frank waiting... B126  MIA  My aunt lived in Paris for a bit... She  used to tell me these stories, when I was  growing up, about living abroad...  (beat)  I remember -- she told me she jumped into  the Seine once...  She pauses, and then continues --   in SONG.   [TRACK: AUDITION]  Yes, this audition is different than the rest, and the switch  to song signals just that. Mia’s nerves fade away -- all the  accents and fakery of earlier auditions a distant memory. This  is Mia undisguised -- pure and stark and beautiful...  She uses the story of her aunt jumping into the river to  paint a portrait of all the dreamers in the world -- all the  people who are told they’re nuts for pursuing their passion --  all the so-called “fools” who take the plunge. She sings  about them and for them.   This   is why Mia does what she does --  why she simply has no choice...  The song ends, and we linger on her for a moment. Then...  Revision   73. ...WE DISSOLVE TO:  EXT. GRIFFITH PARK - DAY 127  Mia and Sebastian sit on a bench, the Observatory perched  behind them. The clouds have parted, and it’s now a gorgeous  Los Angeles afternoon, minutes before dusk.  Sebastian looks at Mia. A moment passes.  SEBASTIAN  When do you find out?  MIA  They said the next couple of days... But  I’m not expecting to find anything out.  SEBASTIAN  You’re going to get it.  MIA  No, I’m not.  SEBAST",

      "slugline": "INT. JAZZ CLUB - CONTINUOUS 143  Inside, a JAZZ COMBO is tearing through a fast bop chart. The  seats around the band are almost all occupied. Young fans,  older couples, passersby trickling in from outside. It’s an  excited crowd,   far   more varied than what we saw at the  Lighthouse -- a real range of ages and styles.  Mia’s eyes drift as David heads to the bar. She recognizes the  images on the walls -- all Sebastian’s. Recognizes a stool by  the bar -- also Sebastian’s, formerly Hoagy Carmichael’s...  DAVID (CONT’D)  Mia?  She turns to David. Wavering, unsure what to do, she follows  him as he manages to find two empty seats close to the  bandstand...  The combo finishes. Hearty applause. A young PIANIST rises  from the keys, waves “thanks”.  And -- just then --   Sebastian appears.   Mia looks at him,  frozen.  SEBASTIAN  (taking the microphone)  Manny Halloran, ladies and gentlemen.  (more applause)  I don’t know, I told him to play “Jingle  Bells”.  The crowd laughs. Sebastian smiles, looks at them --  -- and sees Mia.  Shock. The two LOCK EYES -- and you can tell it’s the first  time they’ve seen each other in years.  A prolonged silence. Sebastian is speechless.  Then -- forcing himself to keep on a face --  SEBASTIAN (CONT’D)  Welcome to Seb’s.  More applause. Sebastian sits at the piano. Looks at the keys.  He seems uncertain -- perhaps unsure what to play. He looks at  Mia. Takes the sight in. Beat. Then looks at his fellow  musicians. Murmurs to them. Then turns back to the keys --  -- and finally starts playing.  Revision   81.",

      "action_text": "A quieter tune, just piano, soft and tender and melancholy. A  melody we -- and Mia -- instantly recognize...  It’s Mia and Sebastian’s song.  Mia looks at Sebastian. He looks at her, then back at his keys.  This is the most beautiful we’ve ever heard his playing. The  most tender, and full of emotion, it has ever sounded.  We MOVE CLOSER on Sebastian. We recognize this image. It  recalls the visualization of his dream, back at the RESTAURANT  that night in winter, years ago. Gradually, as Sebastian  plays, his surroundings seem to grow DARKER. Slowly, subtly at  first, with just shifts in lighting, then a shift in  perspective, the interior of the club changes, and soon...  ...we find ourselves back at that same RESTAURANT...   Back when 144   Mia laid eyes on Sebastian for the first time...  Within this fantasy-flashback, Sebastian finishes his piece.  We stick on Mia, watching him as his Boss talks to him. All is  as before, as we remember it... And sure enough, Mia  approaches Sebastian as he walks near her, and --  MIA  I just wanted to say -- I saw your  playing, and I --  -- but instead of brushing past her --  --   Sebastian decks her with a kiss for the ages.  A BURST OF ORCHESTRAL MUSIC. The DINERS in the restaurant spin  around to face Mia and Sebastian -- and SNAP their fingers in  time. Even the Boss starts to DANCE. Mia and Sebastian grin --  and then strut out together, hand in hand...   [EPILOGUE]  INT. NEW APARTMENT - DAY 145  Mia and Sebastian push open a new door -- to their new place.  It’s a shabby one-bedroom -- but it’s theirs...  INT. LIGHTHOUSE CAFE - NIGHT 146  Next, Keith approaches Sebastian at the Lighthouse -- but  Sebastian immediately shakes his head “no”.  INT. THEATER - NIGHT 147  Sebastian watches Mia perform -- it’s the night of her play.  He stands up to applaud -- and behind him, the entire  theater, utterly   packed , rises as well. A huge standing  ovation. Mia’s ROOMMATES are there, giddy with joy, as are  LAURA and HARRY... ",

This, in fact, is an L.A. that doesn’t exist. A painted-  backdrop L.A., just like the one we saw Mia pass by when  parking on the lot...  The old orange groves and the gabled rooftops and the moss-  covered bungalows and the ivy-decked lamps, the jacaranda  trees and the giant hills and Griffith and the Santa Monica  Pier -- all painted, all props, all figments of a studio-  backdrop imagination. We’ve entered a fully fantastical  realm, the realm of the old Hollywood ballets of the 40’s and  50’s...  Everyone DANCES -- the pedestrians and the street performers A148   and the cops and the guards... AMY BRANDT races up to Mia --  seems to beckon her to audition... We see the audition  silhouetted against a wall... We don’t hear Mia sing, but the  music takes on the melody of her song, carrying us to...  PARIS... Sebastian travels there with Mia... We chart the B148   journey through an OLD GLOBE -- the same one we saw Mia use  for her play -- a miniature plane and dissolves, the old-  Hollywood-movie way...  Finally, we find ourselves looking at a PAINTED BACKDROP of  Paris -- the same one Mia used for her play. The Sacré-Cœur  and the Arc de Triomphe and the Eiffel Tower etched in bright  colors, the ornate lampposts and the cobblestones stretching  before us... And then a sign -- “CAVEAU DE LA HUCHETTE”...  We see a jam session at the Caveau -- a crypt-like jazz club. C148   Sebastian plays, on cloud nine...  We see a MOVIE SHOOT, Mia surrounded by lights and cranes, C148pt   decked in movie-movie glow.  We’re BACK to the Caveau. The lights go out -- except for the  TRUMPETER, playing out a lovelorn solo, rim-lit. We MOVE in  close on his horn -- DIVE into the bell --  -- and emerge into NIGHTTIME PARIS. All painted. Mia and D148   Sebastian wander through this wonderland, pedestrians frozen  around them... Finally, they stop and look at one another...  And -- as the city lights behind them start to glitter like  all the stars of the galaxy...  ...they DANCE.  Revision   83.",

Remember -- this is a romance more perfect than  a real romance could ever be...  We DISSOLVE again -- to a projector beam...  16mm footage plays on a screen, full of scratches and pockets  of light... Mia and Sebastian sit down to watch together --  and we see the following moments in brief, vivid GLIMPSES, as  we move in closer on the imagery:  The first home... (16mm) 149  Mia’s pregnancy... (16mm) 150  The newborn child... (16mm) 151  The child’s first birthday... (16mm) 152  The child’s first day of pre-school, all dressed up... (16mm) 153  Everything here glows with the warmth of old home movies...  These are memories, fluttering by, grabbed at random -- and  yet all concocted, dreamed up out of nothing... The SCORE  continuing to sway and taking us right up to...  Sebastian and Mia, husband and wife, father and mother, 154   hiring a babysitter because they've decided to go out for a  night at the movies... (We’re back to 35mm now.) The look  here is unaffected, just everyday. The MUSIC quiets slightly,  everything goes more natural, as this happily married couple  hit the road...  ...then find themselves blocked by a traffic jam...then take 155   a side route, winding up in another part of L.A...  ...then walk down the street, then hear music -- a jazz combo 156   playing somewhere...  ...and step into a place that looks just like Sebastian’s 157   club... They sit down to listen...  And then -- and this is how our imagined montage-musical  number ends -- the combo’s PIANIST, who of course is not  Sebastian, launches into Mia and Sebastian’s melody...  ...and Mia and Sebastian look at each other, recognizing it.  The music goes full-circle, back to where it started, as Mia  and Sebastian look into each other’s eyes, lean in and,  softly, but with all the love in the world...  ...KISS.  Revision   84.
