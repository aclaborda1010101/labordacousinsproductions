He moves steadily towards her. She turns, catches his gaze. Holds the look for a moment, then turns away. He reaches her. She shows no sign of noticing him. ROBIN I could ask you to dance. You could say you don’t feel like dancing right now. I could say, Next time, maybe. And I could saunter away. DIANA You could saunter away. ROBIN Or I could just not ask. That’s unexpected. She looks at him, unsure what he means. He takes her hand and pulls her onto the dance floor. She’s too taken by surprise to resist. Before she knows what’s happening they’re dancing.
