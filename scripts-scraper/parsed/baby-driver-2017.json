CAR - CONTINUOUS 2   2  Play is pressed on an iPod Classic. A rock track starts up. It’s very loud. It’s awesome.  ‘Bellbottoms’ by the Jon Spencer Blues Explosion.  On high strings and a guitar stab we see the driver.  Young, baby faced. Short cropped hair. He wears mostly black. Sports cheap gas station shades. This is BABY. We can’t see his eyes, but his blank expression seems pretty stoic. He listens to the track, stares out the windshield.  On a 2nd guitar stab   we see a beefy (30s) tough guy in shotgun. This is GRIFF. He too wears shades, black business clothes.  On   a 3rd stab   we see another black clad gentleman. (40s) He’s handsome, but looks like he parties too hard. This is BUDDY.  On   a final stab   we see the last shades wearing black clad passenger, a younger lady (20s) with her hair up. This is DARLING. There’s a hint of trash beneath her business clothes.  The high strings crescendo.   Griff flings his door wide open. INT./EXT. CAR/PARKING LOT - CONTINUOUS 3   3  The track kicks in.   We see the car is a shiny red Honda Civic  and note   the door chimes are in time with the song. Choppy strings play against guitar riffs   as GRIFF gets out. We see a shotgun partially concealed in his trench coat. BUDDY and DARLING get out. We glimpse they are also armed. He pops the trunk. Grabs two duffels. Hands one to Darling. We see they all wear sneakers   as they walk away from the car in  sync with the track.   Again. It’s awesome.   But   we stay with-",

When it kicks back in,   our driver suddenly drops the strong, silent tough guy act and comes to glorious, joyous life. Nodding his head. Swaying in his seat. Mouthing the vocals. A slave to the rhythm. He doesn’t miss a beat. It’s cool, but- He’s also like a   big kid   in front of his bedroom mirror. As he drums on the dash, we see shoppers pass, other cars cruise by. Baby is so   immersed   in the track, he flicks on the wipers.   They swipe across the dry glass in perfect sync.  A mother with a stroller passes. The infant inside notices Baby rocking out in his car. Baby waves. The infant smiles. Then he instinctively looks in his rear view. A BLACK & WHITE POLICE CRUISER, sirens blaring, races up the street behind. Baby turns to watch the police car drive up and past.  A pause in the music.   The police car doesn’t return.  An urgent bass line . Baby looks to the bank. His goofy chair dance is over. He’s stone faced and all business again.  Over distorted guitars,   our driver watches through partially frosted windows. Sees his colleagues ordering staff to hit the floor. Glimpses scared faces, the brandishing of weapons.  The song reaches an interlude;   a vocal comes in   and Baby lip syncs every word   as his eyes stay fixed on the bank.  JON SPENCER (IN SONG) “Thank you very much, ladies and gentlemen.” A snare hits.   An ALARM sounds. Baby steels himself.  Military snares build   like staccato machine gun fire.   His colleagues explode out of the bank, two bags full. Baby revs   in time with the snares   as his colleagues get in. Our driver glances at the bank sign. ‘CHASE’. He pops the car into reverse. Stomps the gas, hard.  Snare drums crescendo.   The car screams back through the tight spaces between parked cars, makes a tight Rockford to face forward. Baby drops into drive. Swerves wide onto -  2.",

THE STREETS OF LA - CONTINUOUS 4   4  JON SPENCER “I’m gonna daaaaance.”  Baby’s car sails into busy traffic,   the track blasting on the car stereo, building in speed and energy.  Despite the velocity of the getaway, our driver is calm at the wheel, weaving through traffic like an android. The other gang members lay low in their seats, shrug out of their business attire. They trade looks as Baby swerves. WOOP WOOP. One BLACK & WHITE cruiser screams the opposite way. It zooms past, then makes a 180 behind them. Baby sees the Black & White BEHIND. A light turns red AHEAD. He FLOORS it through the stop light. Other drivers break hard around him. Cars crash, rear end   in time with kick drum hits.  The Black & White flies through the intersection, gaining. Baby nears 70 mph,   the track building with cracking snares.   The lone Black & White still dogs behind. Sirens wailing. Baby HITS 70 mph. Then 80. Comes up to an intersection. Eases off. Makes a hard right at the last second into - A side street. Loses the Black & White. Baby TEARS down the narrow street, dodges dumpsters. On the adjacent artery, the Black & White can be seen in parallel. Baby floors it to the next cross street and SWERVES a hard left, directly into the path of the Black & White pursuing. Baby plows through this intersection, forcing the Black & White and all other traffic to brake VIOLENTLY HARD. The Honda Civic leaves the Black & White in the dust and tears down another straight with less traffic. Baby holds the gas down. Sees something before we do -  JON SPENCER (CONT’D) “I’m gonna break, I’m gonna break!”  Baby brakes, pulls hard on the wheel, accelerates through a 180 skid, roars in back the other direction with - THREE BLACK & WHITES now on his tail. Red and Blues. Sirens.  3.",

THE 405 FREEWAY - CONTINUOUS 5   5  The Black & Whites are left behind as Baby revs past the green light and into aggressive morning traffic. 85... 90.  Highly distorted guitar   signals the arrival of a POLICE HELICOPTER. It dogs above, but has to play find-the-lady with at least   three red Honda Civics   currently southbound. Baby weaves from lane to lane. As he disappears under a bridge, he crosses to the shoulder and barrels along it at a crazy speed. Tears down the off ramp. And he’s back onto - EXT. THE STREETS OF LA - CONTINUOUS 6   6  MASS HONKS as Baby blows through a intersection. Disappears down an alley, weaving these back routes like a savant. As sirens and choppers’ blades ebb away a little, we see Baby ease it down,   a rising bass riff   signals a sneaking approach . He slows to see if any cruisers cross by ahead. One police cruiser glides by, sirens off. Baby waits   on the bass riff again.   Then floors it when the coast’s clear. And suddenly - They pull into a covered parking lot underneath a quiet shopping complex and pull up next to a green Toyota Corolla.  And like that , the gang leap out of the Civic and into the switch car, money and guns covered up. The gang swap places. Buddy and Griff in the back. Baby shotgun, Darling drives. Lets her hair down. Pulls on a colorful sweater. Baby closes his eyes, pretends to be asleep as Darling roars into the white of morning   and the Blues Explosion echoes out.  And the first musical number is over. That was something. EXT. DOWNTOWN BUSINESS DISTRICT - LATER 7   7  OVER CREDITS: ‘Harlem Shuffle’ by Bob & Earl.

Bats and Co. treat their new member with curiosity and malicious glee; their jazzy patter overlapping like Altman. They talk around him, at him, project onto him. J.D. This is him Doc?

They got our momma’s jewels. They got our girlfriend in there. So let’s go in, get them, get her. Take back what is rightfully ours. Darling opens her door. It starts. There’s a thunderclap.  A crunchy electric guitar joins the piano. Adds menace.  Buddy and Bats watch Darling walk into the post office alone. Baby gets a pervasive feeling of dread. A baby in a stroller cries. A chorus of honks and angry drivers are heard nearby.  A bass guitar joins the sneaking melody.   Buddy and Bats get out, take bags from the trunk and follow Darling. Baby is distracted by an argument between two men at a bus stop.  A huge thunder clap and cymbal crash heralds the introduction of drums.   And also Buddy and Bats entering the post office.  The tempo of the track quickens.   Traffic noise flares nearby. Baby stares forward. Rain spots his windshield. Baby hits the wipers. They are in perfect time with the track. He stays, fixed forward, staring at the jagged mess of protruding poles, fixating on this premonition of doom.  Tempo quickens.   Rain thickens. Baby flicks the wipers up a notch in speed. In his wing mirror, Baby sees - A SECURITY GUARD ambling around the corner. Looks up at the uncommon rainfall. Finishes off a sandwich.  84.",

      "action_text": "A squeal of feedback.   Baby looks through the post office door. He can see frantic activity inside. He looks back to the security guard who has thrown the sandwich wrapper in the trash and now slowly approaches Baby.  The tempo quickens. The drums become more manic.   Baby flicks the wipers to go one faster. Matching the tempo. The security guard passes, eyeballing Baby. Then - A GUN SHOT. From inside. Baby and the Guard look to the door. Baby doesn’t want to think what just happened in there. The Guard runs to the door of the post office. Just as - Buddy, Darling and Bats run out, bags and guns in hand.  Hard cymbals strike. White noise guitar. Madly fast piano.  The Security Guard reaches for a walkie. BATS BLOWS HIM AWAY WITH A SHOTGUN. POINT BLANK. Baby witnesses this. Close up. He is in total shock. BATS THEN SHOOTS THE SECURITY GUARD ON THE GROUND TOO. Sound EXPLODES around them. AN ALARM. SCREAMS from passersby. The sound of distant SIRENS as - Darling and Buddy leap in the back and Bats jumps in shotgun.  A huge shift up in tempo, the track threatening to collapse.  BATS (CONT’D) Move! Baby   doesn’t   move. BATS (CONT’D) Fucking move! Baby   doesn’t   go. BATS (CONT’D) Fucking hit the gas you fucking retard. Fucking move. Go! Bats HITS Baby in the face with the shotgun stock. It knocks out a lens from his sunglasses. We now see one naked eye. One steely eye. Baby   doesn’t   move. Baby   doesn’t   go.  85. BUDDY Baby go! Go now! BATS I’m blowing your fucking head off in three seconds if you don’t move! DARLING Move! Bats POINTS the barrel of his shotgun at Baby’s head. BATS 1- Sirens mass. Baby holds still. That steely eye staring at Bats. BATS (CONT’D) 2-  Music and noise crescendos around them . And then - BATS (CONT’D) 3! Baby HITS the gas. Drives hard and fast.   Straight into   - The back of the Pickup Truck. The concrete poles. WRECKING THE PASSENGER SIDE OF THE CAR AND IMPALING BATS.  A blast of violent noise. Wailing distorted feedback.  BATS IS DE",

One ear bud is back in and the track’s   crazy oompah breakdown  mixes with the disorienting noise of many plasma screens. Outside Baby sees the cops run past the store. Their path takes his easily distracted eye to a display of televisions. Playing on the screens is a scene from   ‘Top Hat’   where FRED ASTAIRE tap dances and mimes the massacre of the chorus with his cane a substitute for a submachine gun. All danger briefly fades as Astaire dancing syncs up with Baby’s music. The TVs are placed next to mirrored pillars.  Creating a kaleidoscopic effect that mesmerizes...  It’s fleeting. The cops are back.   Breakdown is over.  The huge guitar riff returns   and Baby runs through the store, heading not for the exit, but for the staff room. He busts through their stock room and past yelling employees to find - INT. FIRE EXIT STAIRS - CONTINUOUS 78   78  Baby busts down the stairs. TRIPS ALARMS. Up above the cops burst into the stairwell. Baby sees them. But doesn’t see - The cop who enters the stairwell at a lower level. FUCK. Baby hits him at full speed. Knocks them both flying. The cop slams hard into the door he just opened. Baby tumbles down the next set of stairs. He recovers with a limp. Escapes to - EXT. RUNDOWN MALL PARKING LOT - CONTINUOUS 79   79  Baby races into the full lot, shaking off his new injury. He zeroes in on models of cars from the pre-immobilizer era. Spots a 91 Accord, a 95 Civic, a 2003 Corolla. As the cops burst into the parking lot, Baby disappears down amongst the parked cars, out of their view. While on the ground, he tries the doors of the nearest vehicles. Then, right in front on him. Cops. Run past on foot. Missing him.  89.",

He opens the door and sits in the glass as a   hectic drum solo plays.  He tries to hot wire it. But the engine won’t kick over. He slumps down in his seat. Cops are running back and forth.  The rising vocal section builds. Hits a peak.  The engine fires up and Baby LURCHES forward. His seat belt alarm chimes as he pulls a tight 90 degree turn. Cops spot him. Some fire. Sending other shoppers screaming. Baby roars forward in the Corolla, clipping trolleys and non- compacts as he goes. His wheels SCREAM as he settles into the new car and turns perfect corners to get out of this maze.  As two guitars rapidly solo,   Baby leaves the cops behind, snaking through the lot when - BOOM. He ploughs hard into a car that is reversing at speed. It’s a grey Silverado with broken windows. In the front - BUDDY AND DARLING. No fucking way. BUDDY No fucking way! Cops descending. Both Baby and Buddy try to get their cars started again. Buddy’s ride is fucked. It’s not happening. Buddy SCREAMS at Baby. The veins in his neck bulging. BUDDY (CONT’D) Are you a fucking jinx, you maggot?  The crazy vocals rise again.   Sirens are getting close. Buddy and Darling jump out of their car. Move toward Baby’s. DARLING Get us out of here Baby! This is your fucking mess. An LAPD bullhorn barks for them to put down their - BRAT BRAT BRAT. Darling lets rip in the bullhorn’s direction. Buddy is about to fire too, when return fire EXPLODES from three cops using nearby parked cars as a blockade. Buddy ducks, but DARLING IS HIT. And HIT. And HIT. And HIT.  90. Baby is still in the car and can see two things.  1) DARLING’S BODY RIDDLED WITH BULLETS AND JERKING WILDLY. 2) BUDDY’S FACE TURNING EXPRESSIONLESS, EYES SEEING RED.  The bullets stop. Darling drops DEAD. The bullhorn resumes - L.A.P.D Put your guns dow - Nope. Buddy strides around the car a",

(rewind) You’re going to go to the florist's-  Baby stops the tape. It makes no sense to him. He looks around him. The world feels so alien without music. He sees the auto reverse button. He pushes it. The tape flips. He hears from way earlier.  NICE LADY TELLER (ON TAPE) It would be nice to get away. With all this heat.  VEEP. Baby rewinds it. Listens again. Suddenly it becomes clear. Baby looks at the money, the gun, the bag. And suddenly hears -  ‘Theme From Shaft’ by Isaac Hayes.  It’s in his head telling him to get up and get out. Baby looks determined. He then realizes that it’s not in his head. Nor is it Isaac Hayes. He looks up to see - A red tricked out 2012 Ford Mustang V6 Premium driven by Black GANGBANGERS pulls up near Baby. They listen to the Shaft sampling-   ‘Know How’ by Young MC.  One would not normally fuck with these guys, but the music moves Baby to stand up, walk over and order them to - BABY Get out. The young Gangbangers look up. Laugh at this white kid.

I wanna buy it. More of them laugh at this. Baby points the gun firmly. BABY (CONT’D) I’m serious. Sell me your car. Uh okay. The laughter is more muted as Baby forces them out at gunpoint. They slowly leave the Mustang, hands aloft. As Baby gets to the driver’s door, he tosses a huge stack of bills to the original owner. His friend wows at the amount. GANG 2 This some crazy ass shit. Baby goes to reverse out when the driver shouts - GANG 1 Yo yo. Can I get my iPhone? The driver reaches inside. Baby points the gun at him.
