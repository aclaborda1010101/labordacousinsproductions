Reacher's   P.O.V.   The   credit   card   statement   shows   two items   over   and   over;   MARSH   SUPERMARKET   and   EXXON. REACHER Eyewitness   testimonies? HELEN Back   seat.

A   FEMALE   CIVIL   SERVANT   from   inside   the   DMV. A   BUSINESSWOMAN   lying   on   the   pavement   behind   a   kiosk. For   a   beat   we   think   she's   bleeding   out.   Then   we   see she's   laying   in   a   pool   of   four   spilled   ventes. Each   witness   tunes   into   the   shooting   at   a   slightly different   moment,   sees   a   different   victim   die.

SUNKEN   ROAD   -   NIGHT  Cash   aims   at   another   light   by   Vlad   as: ZZZZZZZMACK   -   A   bullet   strikes   the   ground   just   inches from   his   face   -   throws   dirt   and   gravel   in   his   eyes. Cash   drops,   blinded.  EXT.   CONCRETE   FACTORY   -   CROWS   NEST   -   NIGHT  Charlie   turns   his   sights   back   to   the   field   but Reacher   is   gone.  EXT.   CONCRETE   FACTORY   -   EDGE   OF   COMPOUND   -   NIGHT  Meanwhile   two   Thugs   round   a   long   row   of   shipping containers   at   the   edge   of   the   compound,   expecting   to find   Reacher   but   finding   only   darkness. 112. ANGLE   ON:   A   Third   Thug   lingers   on   the   other   side   of the   shipping   container,   watching   the   back   door,   so   to speak.   Reacher   emerges   from   the   darkness   behind   him, knife   in   hand.   The   Thug   turns   at   the   last   second   and fires   as   Reacher   grabs   the   muzzle.  EXT.   EDGE   OF   COMPOUND   -   FAR   SIDE   OF   CONTAINERS   -   NIGHT  The   other   Two   thugs   hear   this   and   run   toward   it.  EXT.   CONCRETE   FACTORY   -   EDGE   OF   COMPOUND   -   NIGHT  The   rapidly   firing   gun's   muzzle   sears   Reacher's   palm but   he   holds   tight.   With   his   other   hand   he   drives   the knife   into   the   Thug's   chest,   shoving   him   back   into the   shipping   container.   The   machine   gun   continues   to fire.   Reacher   takes   the   pain,   pounding   the   knife   with  his   elbow   until   the   Thug   drops. His   left   palm   blistering,   Reacher   grabs   the   Thug's gun   but   it   is   slung   to   the   dead   weight   of   his   body. Reacher   tries   to   pull   out   the   knife,   but   the   blade   is stuck   fast.   He   brings   the   sling   to   the   blade   instead, slicing   it   clean   through.   He   has   a   gun   but   it's empty.   He   searches   the   thug   for   magazines. ANGLE   ON:   The   two   Thugs   rounding   the   shipping container   as: Reacher   finds   a   magazine,   quickly   jams   it   home, charges   the   weapon   as:",

But:  KAKAKAKAKA   -   Bullets   pepper   the   shipping   container. Reacher   hits   the   ground   and   returns   fire,   seeing: Vlad,   ducking   for   cover.   Reacher   gets   up   and   presses the   attack,   firing   in   short   controlled   bursts,   moving from   one   position   of   cover   to   the   next.   Vlad   is   doing the   same   until   finally. Reacher's   gun   is   empty.   Vlad   emerges   from   cover,  steps   out   to   get   a   clear   shot   and   pulls   the   trigger.  CLICK   -   Vlad   is   out,   too.   He   goes   for   a   spare magazine.   Reacher   doesn't   have   one.   He   drops   the machine   gun   and   rushes   Vlad   as   the   Russian   quickly reloads,   driving   the   magazine   home,   jerking   the   bolt-  WHAM   -   Reacher   hits   him   like   a   train.   The   two   men   go down   hard,   grappling   close-in   with   a   loaded   machine- gun   between   their   bodies.   Vlad   has   control   of   the trigger,   Reacher   the   muzzle.   Stalemate   then:  WHAM   -   Reacher   head-butts   Vlad   in   the   nose,   buying   a few   seconds   of   control.   He   wrenches   the   gun clockwise,   turning   the   sling   into   a   tourniquet   around Vlad's   neck   and   chest.   Vlad   punches   Reacher,   trying to   break   free.   It   becomes   a   fight   to   see   who   can   stay conscious   longer.   Vlad   loses.   He   collapses,   dead. Winded,   bleeding,   Reacher   stands,   looks   toward   the  silo   at   the   center   of   the   compound.   He   grabs   Vlad's gun   and   heads   toward   it.  EXT.

Emerson   considers   his   options   and   makes  his   move,   aiming   like   lighting   at   Reacher   as: Reacher   shoulders   the   rifle   just   as   fast   and: CRACK/CRACK CLOSE   ON:   Helen.

Reacher   puts   down   the   rifle, takes   the   pistol,   puts   an   arm   around   her. HELEN You   were   wrong   ...   About   my   father. REACHER Don't   get   all   smug   about   it.
