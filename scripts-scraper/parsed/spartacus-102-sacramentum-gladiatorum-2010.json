LUCRETIA Spartacus   is   a   corpse   yet   walking. How   long   before   he   takes   his   place in   the   grave,   dragging   your investment   with   him? BATIATUS Not   before   he   serves   his   purpose. Batiatus   produces   a   small   SCROLL   from   his   robes. BATIATUS (cont'd) From   Legatus   Claudius   Glaber. That   gets   her   attention. LUCRETIA His   intentions? BATIATUS Nudging   toward   my   desires. He   hands   her   the   scroll.   She   unravels   it,   reads   in surprise.

I offered   alternative,   by   purchasing him. LUCRETIA At   inflated   worth. BATIATUS If   Spartacus   survives   to   swear   the oath,   the   arena   will   be   his   tomb   as first   intended.   If   not,   his passing   becomes   an   early   delight for   the   Legatus. Lucretia   smiles   as   she   stretches   out   on   the   bed.   Naked. Powerful   in   her   sexuality. LUCRETIA Desires   well   nudged. BATIATUS There’s   yet   more   stroking   needed. Batiatus   glances   down   at   his   nakedness   with   a   frown. Lucretia   signals   a   FEMALE   SLAVE   to   prepare   Batiatus   for lovemaking.   The   Slave   gets   on   her   knees,   “fluffing”   him. BATIATUS (cont'd) A   simple   gesture   of   gratitude   from him   falls   short.   Patronage   is   the reward   we   seek.   Nothing   short   of it. Lucretia’s   hand   drops   between   her   legs,   preparing   herself for   her   husband.   Naevia   fans   her. LUCRETIA The   Legatus   as   patron... BATIATUS His   coins...   will   fill   our   pool   to overflowing. Batiatus   grips   the   Slave   Girl’s   head,   thrusting   harder. LUCRETIA We’ll   need   to   prepare   a   feast. (CONTINUED) CONTINUED:   5. BATIATUS A   small   one. LUCRETIA With   wine.   And   water.   Lots   of water. BATIATUS Just   enough...   to   wet   the   tongue. LUCRETIA I’ll   sacrifice   a   bull.   To   appease the   gods   in   our   venture. BATIATUS Perhaps   something   smaller...? LUCRETIA A   ram,   then. Batiatus   pushes   the   Slave   Girl   away,   climbs   into   bed. BATIATUS To   the   gods.   May   they   bless   us with   good   fortune... Batiatus   GRUNTS   as   he   slides   into   Lucretia.   Naevia’s   FAN WIPES   US   TO   -- INT.   BATH   -   BATIATUS’   LUDUS   -   NIGHT Naked   Gladiators   laugh   and   bath",
