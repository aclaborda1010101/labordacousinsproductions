Bearded, tufts of white on his pate. A small radio plays music with alligator clips to a car battery. CHARLES Friends, I have Good News today! It's not about what you do. It's not about your deeds. You can't live up to his rules. God knows you can't. That's OK! We're imperfect! Logan steps over a dumped tray of food, approaches Charles with the meds. Charles swings his chair around him.

He reaches down and picks up the disoriented old man-- CHARLES How long have I been here? Logan carries him to the bed and sets him down. Charles looks around, in tears. Logan doesn’t answer, dumps two pills into his palm which he transfers to Charles' hand. CHARLES (CONT’D) What are these? LOGAN You remember what they are. The shots mellow the seizures, the pills keep them from happening. Charles stares at the pills. LOGAN (CONT’D) How ‘bout you blow on them to make them safe. Charles looks up at Logan. Final Shooting - 8/23/2016   12. CHARLES Fuck off, Logan. LOGAN So you know who I am now. CHARLES I always know who you are. Sometimes I just don't recognize you. LOGAN Take the pills.

Once the Reaver passes, Lizard Boy steps out from the tree, thinking he is safe, and turns to find Pierce standing there. He fires his side arm into the boy's chest. LIZARD BOY Ow. Lizard boy drops to the ground and Pierce leaves his body to be dragged away by Reavers behind him.  NOT FAR AWAY IN THE WOODS - - DR. RICE rides in a jeep with two soldiers. He watches the battle ahead from a safe distance. Behind him lumbers the Alkali Control Vehicle. RICE Move faster. We can't let them get to the border.  ELSEWHERE IN THE WOODS --  ELLA is cornered by several soldiers, who advance on her. Her eyes roll up in her head as she draws on her powers and -- PINE NEEDLES LIFT FROM THE GROUND AND TEAR FROM THE TREES, swirling into a whirlwind. The needles envelope the soldiers in a vortex, blinding them, stabbing them, shredding their skin, filling their mouthes, gagging them. A SOLDIER GRABS ELLA from behind, covering her eyes. The needles fall to the ground. As he proceeds to shackle her wrists-- LAURA LEAPS UPON HIM, SPEARING HIM WITH HER CLAWS. Laura and Ella run away as other soldiers fire upon them.

Soldiers converging, Laura flees toward other children up ahead. Some soldiers turn as they hear -- gunfire and mens' screams from behind them --  BEHIND THEM, IN THE WOODS -- 173C   173C  LOGAN SPRINTS THROUGH THE TREES. Speeding. Full strength. We have never seen him before like this. He is Weapon X in a full berserker rage. His body restored by the huge dose of the drug, he cuts his way through Reavers and Soldiers one after another like a saw blade. They fire on him but it doesn't matter, he heals instantly. Each of them are gored and slashed and killed as Logan races toward the children up ahead, overtaking the Alkali convoy.

Logan appears from nowhere and kills them in an instant. A guerilla warrior, dropped back in the jungle for one last battle.  ELSEWHERE IN THE WOODS --  JONAH uses his ocular mirror connection, making one of the Reavers AIM HIS GUN AT HIS OWN MEN, MOWING THEM DOWN.
