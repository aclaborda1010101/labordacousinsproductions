BARMAN  Half a minute. Gotta go down and  change the barrel.  Obviously rattled, he disappears down the hole in the floor  to the cellar. As he pulls the trap door down over his head --  -- Four customers scurry out. The other EIGHT are RICHARDSON  GANGSTERS. Approaching from all sides. Tough bastards. Tooled  up with coshes and pipes. One, Mike Jobber, holds a razor.  MIKE JOBBER  Reg, Ron, the Richardsons were  unexpectedly engaged. We’re going to  look after you.  RON  (re: Jobber’s razor)  What’s that supposed to be?  MIKE JOBBER  What do you think? It’s a tool.  RON  No it’s not; it’s a fucking utensil.  What are you going to do with that,  fry me an egg?  Ron indicates some hard metal shoved down in his pockets.  Pistols? As Jobber frowns...  RON (CONT’D)  I came here for a shoot out. A  proper shoot out with some proper  men! Like Colonel Custer and  Geronimo.  (turns)  Reg, this lot are fucking nonces.  (to Jobber)  Get out of my way.

Reggie reaches over the bar, starts to POUR a GUINNESS.  Jobber trades incredulous looks with the others.  MIKE JOBBER  Charlie Richardson said we’re to  knock the granny out of you, Reg.

Reggie pulls his hands out of his pockets, both fists held  tight around BRASS KNUCKLES.  LAUGHS all around. They’re not intimidated. Only Reggie sees:  RON quietly slip back into the bar from the OTHER ENTRANCE,  behind them, a HAMMER in each hand. Reggie smiles.  REGGIE (CONT’D)  You think I’m joking? Try this one  then. A paranoid schizophrenic walks  into a bar...  Ron doesn’t break stride as SWING! Blind-sides the rear man.  Jobber crumples even as Reggie wades in.
