Amelia, no.  He approaches the frozen figure of AMELIA HAYTES,   a striking,  beautiful, Caucasian woman, 30, blue backpack slung over one  shoulder, an AUTOMATIC RIFLE in her hands, angrily pointing  it at a group of HOSTAGES. Standing next to her is another  GUNMAN, the FLAME from his gun barrel suspended in mid-burst.  As Gabriel approaches them, WE SEE a rapid DATA STREAM in  Gabriel’s POV - THE MAN’S NAME, COUNTRY OF ORIGIN - PAKISTAN -  AND HIS INTERNATIONAL RAP SHEET. Gabriel turns back to Amelia  and a similar DATA STREAM flashes various images, a CIA ID,  and her name.  GABRIEL (CONT’D)  How could you...
