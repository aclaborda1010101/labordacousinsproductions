Today her name is “Jess,” tomorrow it could be “Lisa” or “Amber.” It all depends on the day, it depends on my mood. Later that night, as the train slows, Rachel nears the blue house (23 Beckett Road). She looks to her lap, letting it pass. She raises her head and looks at Number 15 Beckett Road. ...NOW, Megan and Scott can be seen kissing through the window of their house. RACHEL The truth is, I don’t know her name.
