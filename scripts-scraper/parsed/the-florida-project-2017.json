She approaches her blue 90’s Toyota Corolla to see a spit-covered windshield. A gob of spit shoots down onto it from above. She looks to the upper floor. GRANDMA STACY What the fuck? HEY! Moonee/Scooty/Dicky slide back and laugh.  2. GRANDMA STACY (CONT’D) Are you kidding me over here? You get down here and clean this shit up now! The commotion causes Jancey and her young sister LUCI (4) to emerge from the room. The kids continue to LAUGH HYSTERICALLY. Moonee jumps up and spits blindly through the rail.
