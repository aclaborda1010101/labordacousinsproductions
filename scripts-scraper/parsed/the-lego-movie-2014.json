Everywhere are dozens of STREET SIGNS offering detailed  instructions for what you should and shouldn’t do.  Everyone drives the same speed in the same direction,  listening to the same station, moving to the same beat.  MUSIC: An insanely catchy pop song.  RADIO DJ  It’s another beautiful day in  Legopolis and on Empura Radio.  Reminding you don’t forget to re-  elect President Iamnotarobot for  President of the City on Tuesday.  Now, for the 258th consecutive  week at #1, here’s the No News  Gnus with their hit “Everything is  Awesome.”  EMMET  Yeah.   I love this song!   And so  does everyone else!  In what feels like a musical number, Emmet drives past  vignettes of citizens happily going about their day and  loving this song!   BILLBOARDS everywhere advertise  EMPURA, a company which apparently owns everything.  EXT. ALTERNATIVE AVENUE - DAY  Everyone walks in the same direction and goes in to  various identical-seeming coffee shops.  SECURITY CAMERA FOOTAGE: A camera scans for something, or  someone, but can’t tell Emmet from the rest of the crowd.  INT. KREATIVE KOFFEE - DAY  A Starbucks by a different name.   Mixed with a Hot Dog on  a Stick.   Emmet arrives at the counter.  EMMET  Hello.  BARRISTA  What’ll it be?  EMMET  I’m Emmet.  8.",

EMMET  You creative types!   So  delightfully sardonic!  BARRISTA  I push one of two buttons on a  machine.   I would hardly call that  creative.   I would call that  following instructions.  EMMET  But it says Kreative right on your  shirt!   With an extra “kreative”  spelling aberration!   I totally  don’t get it!  EXT.

A television in a shop window shows highlights of a  debate between Iamnotarobot and Stooge Strawman.  Emmet finishes the drive to work. Everyone pulls into  their parking spaces at the same time, like clockwork.  Emmet walks out and looks at his new work place.   His  breath is taken away as he gazes on a beautiful...  EXT. INSTRUCTION SITE - DAY  A fantastical construction site.   Super-awesome cranes.  Emmet walks and talks to his new boss.  FOREMAN  Alright, kid.   Here’s the rules.  EMMET  Ooh, great.  FOREMAN  Stay on your feet--  EMMET  Mmm hmm.  FOREMAN  Stick to the instructions--  EMMET  Uh huh.  10. FOREMAN  And don’t get creative!  Emmet GUFFAWS like that’s the craziest idea ever.

The  Black Falcon’s office penthouse is one of the top pegs,  looking over everything like a control tower.   Emmet  notices his instruction worker pals from Act I.  EMMET  They got promoted...  THE BLACK FALCON  Behold:   The SuperKragleThingy  Part II.  Reveal a huge   ROBOTIC MONSTER , a hundred men tall, like a  mechanical Godzilla-raptor.   It has a name plate reading  “Brought to you by Empura”.  THE BLACK FALCON  It’s my best work.  EMMET  But you didn’t do anything.  THE BLACK FALCON  Are you kidding?   You think the  MasterBuilders just up and forced  themselves   to think of this?   Did  those guys force   themselves   to  build it?   No.   I did.   Ergo, it’s  mine.   (then)  Look down there.  88.",

And now it  will be just the way I want.  A worker puts the last piece on.   Another flips a switch.  The SuperKragleThingy Part II (”SKT2”) lights up!  THE BLACK FALCON  Release the Kragle!  They watch below as HUNDREDS of Bad guys in helmets  stream into HUNDREDS of cockpits all over the SKT2.   They  put in ignition keys in unison.

He points across the hangar: There are a bunch of  spaceships.  NECKBEARD  What about Lucy and the others?  BENNY  We’ll come back for them. After we  stop that Kragle.  He’s right. They make a break for it, as the huge hangar  door starts closing. They run up to a black spaceship.  89. BENNY  Can we go in the blue one?  Bad Cop spots them, flanked by RoboNinjas.  BAD COP  There they are!  Bad Cop and the RoboNinjas run after them.  NECKBEARD  What does it matter?  BENNY  I fly better in blue.  They run over to the blue spaceship and pile in just in  time to BLAST OFF just as the hangar door closes!  BAD COP  No! Re-open the door! Everyone in  ships! Go!  ROBONINJA  Dude, you don’t have to yell.  The RoboNinjas pop off their ninja veils and pop on space  helmets, climb in the remaining ships and take off!  EXT.

THE BLACK FALCON  If you want to get something done,  you have to do it yourself!!!  He pushes a button marked “TURBO” and sends a nuclear  bomb of Kragle Belch out of the SKT2’s mouth.

The army of citizens runs as fast as it can towards the  SKT2 to avoid getting in the line of glue, but the Kragle  blast arrives, and many of them are FROZEN!

He is traveling  between the seams.   Eventually rising straight towards  the brightest star in the sky.  The closer we get, we realize that it is not a star at  all, but a HOLE in the fabric of the universe.   A hole  just barely big enough for Emmet to fit through.   Well,  not quite big enough.

He rubs his eyes and sees an entire human-  sized basement in a LIVE ACTION WORLD.   It’s like nothing  Emmet has ever seen before.  He marvels at a coffee cup with pencils in it.   Stares at  his reflection in a snowglobe.  EMMET  So...not square.  Something catches his eye.   He turns around and sees  AN ENTIRE LEGO UNIVERSE laid out below. It’s a more  mundane version of Emmet’s world: the lands are not as  vast, towers not as tall, but it’s all there:  representations of the city, waterfall, space cube, etc.  Each area separated by walls - backdrops laid down by a  collector.   It’s pretty much the coolest collection of  LEGO sets anyone could ever hope to build.  He looks at his feet and sees tons of loose LEGO parts.  He realizes he’s standing in the middle of a bin of  LEFTOVER LEGO pieces.  EMMET  The Maker.   It’s all real...  He looks up to see   TED, a human being , staring at him.  EMMET  DAHHH!!!!

It’s all messed  up from the fighting.  EMMET  Did you build that?  TED  Yeah, but it’s seriously messed  up.  EMMET  Are you the Maker?  TED  The what?  (then)  FINN!!!
