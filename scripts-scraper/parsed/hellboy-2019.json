Through the windows of the cantina, we see a HULKING FIGURE in a trench coat and hoodie, drinking and carousing, having a good time before stumbling over and smashing through a table. No one moves to help him as he drunkenly rises back to his feet and stumbles out the door. ACROSS THE STREET - two very TOUGH-LOOKING MEXICANS watch with keen interest as the hulking figure heads off, turning down a dark alley. INT. ALLEY - CONTINUOUS The Mexicans approach from behind as the hooded figure reaches the end of the alley. He suddenly stops, speaking to them without turning around, a deep resounding voice: FIGURE You’ll have to forgive me, my Spanish is a little rusty... He turns, revealing the demonic red face and stubby horns of our titular hero, HELLBOY. HELLBOY How do you say “Big Mistake” in español? As Hellboy steps forward menacingly -- MEXICAN #1 You are the one they call the Hellboy, no? MEXICAN #2 We have heard the stories and are very much in need of your help.

Hellboy considers this a long beat. HELLBOY Where’s your brother now? EXT. WRESTLING ARENA - NIGHT A rundown Lucha Libre arena on the outskirts of town. Vendors selling everything from stale churros to colorful Luchador masks. The CHEERS of a lively crowd rising from within. INT. WRESTLING ARENA - CONTINUOUS MASKED LUCHADORES square-off center ring, a four-man tag-team match, entertaining a packed house with an impressive display of acrobatics and choreographed moves. EL TORO waits outside the ropes, while the masked CRUSADER gets double-teamed by the villainous VASCO BROTHERS. The banners around the arena and fan t-shirts make it apparent that Crusader is a hometown favorite. He plays to his audience, drawing CHEERS from the crowd. But then falters, falls to one knee, in the throes of some spasm. The Vasco Brothers look to one another, not sure what to do. A hush falls over the crowd. The REFEREE leans down to check on their fallen hero, whose eyes suddenly pop open, fiery yellow and bloodshot. 6. Crusader grabs the referee by the throat, forcing the Vasco Brothers to break character in an attempt to rescue the ref. The crowd cheers again, thinking it’s just part of the act. EL TORO (subtitled, in Spanish) Hector, what’s wrong with you? This isn’t what we rehearsed! Crusader glares at El Toro with INHUMAN EYES. He tosses the referee aside and lunges at El Toro, teeth gnashing, CLAWS bursting through his wrestling gloves. HELLBOY (O.S.) Hey, amigo! Crusader stops and turns as Hellboy climbs into the ring. The crowd CHEERS again, assuming Hellboy’s some new masked wrestler there for their entertainment. HELLBOY (CONT’D) ",

How’d you boys find me, anyway? AGENT #1 We never lost you. AGENT #2 The Professor likes us to keep close tabs on all our assets. HELLBOY Did you just call me an   asset ?

Various B.P.R.D. PERSONNEL steal wary glances at Hellboy as he and the two agents stroll through the main corridor.

HELLBOY That’s even worse. As Hellboy heads off, Abe goes back to work on the frog monster, switching on an ELECTRIC BONE SAW. INT. HELLBOY’S ROOM - LATER The sound of the bone saw becomes GRINDING METAL, taking us through a HUGE VAULT DOOR and into Hellboy’s living quarters. A total wreck. Beer cans and pizza boxes piled high. Clothes and comics strewn everywhere. Punk Rock posters covering the walls. Multiple electric guitars with all the strings broken. The grinding grows louder as we PUSH INTO the bathroom, where Hellboy, fresh from the shower with a beach towel wrapped around his waist, stands in front of the mirror, shaving his horns with a BELT SANDER. Satisfied, he switches off the sander and takes a long, hard look at himself in the mirror, closely inspecting the shaved horns and his other demonic attributes. His expression darkens. He PUNCHES the mirror with his big stone fist. INT. B.P.R.D. HEADQUARTERS - LATER More museum than office. Bookshelves filled with dusty tomes and ancient artifacts. A distinguished older gentleman, TREVOR “BROOM” BRUTTENHOLM, sits at a desk, studying an illuminated manuscript with a pair of multi-lensed goggles. 11. Hellboy peeks his head in, already seeming more subdued than we’re used to. Broom looks up, removing the goggles to don his spectacles. The tension between them is palpable. BROOM Ah, the Prodigal Son returns. HELLBOY Father. BROOM Next time you decide to just take off, do me the courtesy of telling somebody where you’re going. HELLBOY I didn’t know where I was going. Just knew I needed to get away. BROOM Because of what happened in New Orleans? HELLBOY Seems like whatever ",

SUPER: HAILES ABBEY, DEVON, ENGLAND  INT. HAILES ABBEY - NIGHT The nave extends from the entry to the chancel, flanked by lower side-aisles, where a small number of MONKS bow their heads in silent prayer. Closer to the altar, we find an elderly ABBOT and his young NOVICE, lighting prayer candles and preparing to join their brethren, when the silence is suddenly broken by a THUNDEROUS POUNDING at the chapel door. The monks share curious glances. Its an odd hour for visitors. Two of them go to investigate -- MONK #1 I’m afraid we’re closed for the evening. MONK #2 You’ll have to come back in the -- BOOM! The huge chapel door suddenly EXPLODES inward, crushing the two monks, killing them instantly. THE GRUAGACH steps through the threshold. A hideous demonic creature with razor sharp teeth and vaguely porcine features, its face made all the more frightening by a jagged burn scar. Upon seeing this, the Novice ducks for cover behind one of the pews. He cowers there, listening to the sounds of HEAVY HOOVES on stone, followed by SHOUTING AND SCREAMING. A monk’s corpse lands next to him. The Novice peeks up from behind the pew to find the other monks dead, their broken bodies strewn across the abbey floor. Only the Abbot remains. The hulking figure looming over him. ABBOT  Pater noster, qui es in caelis --  GRUAGACH By all means, pray. See if He answers. No? All right then. Show me where you keep your secrets. 14.",

NOVICE ...Yes...I believe so. GRUAGACH (back to the Abbot) Then I don’t need you, do I? Gruagach snatches the Abbot up, jaws opening wide. INT. MONASTERY CRYPT - NIGHT Light floods in from above as the Novice opens a secret entrance, leading the Gruagach down into a crypt, filled with the tombs of the previous Abbots. Gruagach TAKES A TORCH from the wall and lights it, shoving the Novice ahead of him. They stop at an IRON VAULT with an intricate locking mechanism set into the stone wall. NOVICE Th...this is it. B...but I don’t have the key. The Gruagach roughly shoves the Novice aside and grabs both sides of the vault door with his clawed hands, RIPPING it from the wall.   Inside is one of the BLOOD QUEEN’S CRATES, wrapped in chains, covered in runes and wards. The Gruagach drags the crate out and drops it to the ground next to the Novice. GRUAGACH Open it. The Novice stares at the box, hopeless. NOVICE I’m only a novice. I-- GRUAGACH Open. NOVICE (desperate) I...I don’t know how to do that. 15. The Gruagach hangs his head in a huff, then picks up the crate with both hands and hurls it at the wall, where it SHATTERS, wood and contents thumping to the stone floor. The novice CRIES OUT, scrambling away from the Gruagach on the floor, then turns as he realizes he’s close to the shattered crate. We see his eyes widen in shock and terror. The Gruagach SNAPS the Novice’s neck. GRUAGACH Welcome back, Your Majesty. The Gruagach smiles, lifts his torch to reveal the BLOOD QUEEN’S SEVERED HEAD, lying in the ruin of the crate. Her eyes suddenly pop open, wide and staring. Still very much ALIVE. EXT. OSIRIS CLUB - DAY A security gate trundles open and a hackney cab is waiting to come through.

One of the huntsmen exits the cottage -- HUNTSMAN I found bodies inside. And a pile of bones near the kitchen. LORD GLAREN Which means they’ll be back. HELLBOY What makes you say that? LORD GLAREN Giants don’t leave food behind. Lord Glaren squats, showing Hellboy the footprints. LORD GLAREN (CONT’D) These tracks go back and forth, coming and going. They’re using this place as a pantry. Hellboy shudders as Lord Glaren and the other huntsmen mount up, arming themselves with their electric lances as they follow the giant prints into the forest, along a path of broken trees. EXT. STONE BRIDGE - MOMENTS LATER Hellboy and the huntsmen dismount as they approach an OLD STONE BRIDGE. Lord Glaren sidles up to Hellboy, points out over the raging river. LORD GLAREN This is where we’ll make our stand. 24. HELLBOY Why here? LORD GLAREN They’ll need the bridge to cross. We can take positions in the brush on either side. HELLBOY Perfect place for an ambush. LORD GLAREN Precisely. As Hellboy starts to turn around -- ZZZAPPPP!! One of the other huntsmen rides up behind him, driving his lance into Hellboy’s back, sending a powerful surge of ELECTRICITY through him. HUNTSMAN Die monster!

COUNCIL HOUSE - DAY FOUR UNMARKED TACTICAL VANS screech to a stop outside the council house. ARMED SOLDIERS file out, dressed in heavy assault gear, rifles at the ready. Taking point is MAJOR BEN DAIMIO, rugged military type with cold, calculating eyes, close-cropped hair and three jagged scars raked across his grizzled face. 30. A few dangerous-looking LOCALS glare as Daimio and his men make their way into the building.

Daimio and his soldiers kick in the front door and rush into the room, guns drawn, taking aim at Alice and Hellboy as they sit there, awkwardly having tea. DAIMIO Clear!

MYRDDIN’S PRISON - MOMENTS LATER Abe, Daimio and Alice await Hellboy’s return when a low rumbling begins to build. The prison shakes. Stones fall from the ceiling. The whole place begins to crumble. Hellboy enters, in a rush, heading straight for the exit. HELLBOY Time to go. INT. CAVERN - MOMENTS LATER They race across the bridge as it collapses behind them, barely making it to the other side as the prison sinks down into the molten lake of fire. EXT. LONDON - DAY Lightning FLASHES as ominous storm clouds gather over London, churning in a reddening, ever-widening maelstrom. 89.",

All around them, bureau personnel work furiously at their computer stations, monitoring the spread of the Blood Queen’s plague. NEWS FOOTAGE of its spread coming in from all over England. BROOM Why haven’t we heard from Hellboy? FIELD AGENT I don’t know. It’s like he and his team just vanished off the grid. (off Broom’s reaction) I’m sure he’s okay, though. BROOM What about the Blood Queen? The agent hands Broom a print-out. FIELD AGENT All indications are that she’s gaining strength. Most recent estimates of the spread put the numbers at close to two hundred. BROOM Infected? FIELD AGENT Deceased. Known infected is nearing a thousand reported cases. And that figure represents just a small fraction. Assume at least ten thousand victims so far, with an anticipated mortality rate of ninety-two percent. Depending on location and mobility of the source, that puts the twelve-hour projection at roughly one hundred and fifty thousand. Broom absorbs the news like a physical blow as they arrive at the wall monitors displaying various NEWS PROGRAMS of the chaos erupting in wake of the epidemic: SCENES of the sick and dying, panic in the streets, hospitals overflowing. An ANCHORWOMAN report on the situation in dire tones: ANCHORWOMAN  ...but so far, the British government has failed to pinpoint the origin of the virus.  (MORE)  90.",

      "action_text": "A growing number of online sources have linked the spread to sightings of this mysterious figure seen wandering the English countryside. Be advised: some viewers may find these images disturbing...  ON-SCREEN - jittery camera-phone footage showing a brief, blurred glimpse of the Blood Queen moving down a city street before the camera is dropped, ending with a plague-riddled face falling into frame. ANCHORWOMAN (CONT’D)  Sightings like these are now being reported all across Great Britain.  (finger to her ear)  Pardon me, but I’ve just received word that the virus has now reached London. The Prime Minister has declared an official State of Emergency, and the World Health Organization is urging residents to stay indoors, avoiding contact with anyone who might be infected...  Suddenly, an ALARM SOUNDS. GUNFIRE and DISTANT SCREAMS come from somewhere inside the facility. BROOM She’s here. FIELD AGENT (checking her computer) There’s been a perimeter breach. (eyes wide) My god! ON-SCREEN - THE GRUAGACH brutally kills several B.P.R.D. AGENTS as he moves deeper into the facility. EXT. ENGLISH COASTLINE - DAY The team pulls itself up and over the top of the bluffs. The helicopter in the distance. DAIMIO I just want to know what happened down there. HELLBOY Not sure I understand it myself.  ANCHORWOMAN (CONT'D)  91. DAIMIO Then how about the broad strokes? Starting with where you and Merlin ran off to. ABE SAPIEN  Myrddin.  DAIMIO Whatever. Something obviously happened to bring the whole place crashing down on our heads. What was it? Hellboy hesitates, then -- HELLBOY He offered me the sword. ABE SAPIEN Excalibur? Abe, Daimio and Alice react, surprised and elated by what they assume to be good news. DAIMIO That’s great! Where is it? HELLBOY I said he offered it to me. I didn’t say I took it. DAIMIO WHAT?!? Why the hell not? HELLBOY Because. Everything they say about me is true. I saw it, when I touched Excalibur. My true face. I was given a glimpse of the monster everyone els",

UNDERGROUND HEADQUARTERS - LATER Deep underground, Hellboy races through the maze of ruined corridors, past more broken corpses of B.P.R.D. agents, until he finally comes to -- INT. BROOM’S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS Hellboy enters to find the body of the FIELD AGENT slumped over the computer, her neck snapped. Professor Broom is nowhere to be scene. Abe, Alice and Daimio arrive to find Hellboy staring at something just off-screen. ABE SAPIEN Any sign of the Professor? HELLBOY They took him. Abe follows Hellboy’s gaze to the shattered wall monitors, where a LARGE CROSS has been painted in blood, along with a single word: SOUTHWARK. ABE SAPIEN Southwark... Southwark Cathedral. DAIMIO (to Hellboy) Blood Queen’s calling you out. Bristling with rage, Hellboy turns and makes for the exit. HELLBOY Then let’s not disappoint her. EXT. STREETS OF LONDON - DAY Amidst the raging storm, tanks and military vehicles roll down the streets. Whole sections of the city are being cordoned off. Martial Law in full effect. EXT. SOUTHWARK CATHEDRAL A handful of POLICE OFFICERS take cover behind their cars outside the church, weapons trained on the Blood Queen, who stands atop the steps, looking out over the city as the epidemic unfolds, reveling in the chaos. 95.",

      "action_text": "They open fire, but the Blood Queen casually waves off the attack, then SENDS HER PLAGUE SWEEPING THROUGH THE OFFICERS, who fall to the ground screaming as they’re consumed by boils and pustules. Onlookers flee in terror. BLOOD QUEEN That’s right, vermin. Time for you to learn what it is like to cower in the shadows. And from those shadows, the Gruagach emerges with Professor Broom in tow. Broom stares up at the Blood Queen defiantly - BROOM You can’t win. Hellboy will come for you. BLOOD QUEEN I’m counting on it. The Blood Queen turns to Gruagach, lovingly caressing his cheek with her hand, nails long and lethal. BLOOD QUEEN (CONT’D) You’ve done well, my pet. And now it is time for your reward... EXT. SOUTHWARK CATHEDRAL - LATER Daimio roughly sets his chopper down outside Southwark Cathedral. Hellboy and the others jump out. A gunshot ricochets off the wall. Hellboy spins angrily at the cops just now arriving on the scene -- HELLBOY I’m on your side, you morons! As Hellboy storms off toward the church, the others share worried glances. They’ve never seen him so close to the edge. Daimio flashes his M-11 badge at the officers. DAIMIO M-11. No one enters, under any circumstances. Is that clear? INT. SOUTHWARK CATHEDRAL - MOMENTS LATER Hellboy kicks open the doors, ready for anything... only to met by an eerie silence. The church is empty. No sign of the Blood Queen. 96. ABE SAPIEN Well that’s rather anti-climactic. They move farther into the nave, on alert, checking pews as they go. But nothing seems out of the ordinary. Hellboy stops when he reaches the altar, confused. HELLBOY Where is she? This doesn’t make sense. ABE SAPIEN Could be they came and went already. HELLBOY So why bring us here? ALICE Maybe we misinterpreted the message. DAIMIO Or maybe the Blood Queen’s led us on another wild goose chase. GRUAGACH (O.S.) Then again, it could be a trap. Startled, they all turn to find the Gruagach standing in the shadows of the cathedral’s southern transept. HELLBOY W",
