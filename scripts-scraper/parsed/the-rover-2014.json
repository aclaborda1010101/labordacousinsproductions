They   both   look   happy. ERIC   (V.O.) I   can't   say   I   even   know what   the   world   is anymore.   I   don't   know what   happened   to   it. I   don't   even   know where   it   is   now,   I   don't know where   its   centre   is,   if   it   even   has   a centre   ••.   All   I   know is   that   its   dirty people   have   crawled   out   here   somehow.   I don't   know why.   I   don't   really   care   anymore anyway.   And that's   all   I'm   gonna   say   about it. CUT TO BLACK: CARDON BLACK: \"Australia.   Some time   in   the   future.\"  INT.   ERIC'S   FALCON -   DAY  Eric   sits   at   the   wheel   of   his   parked   car.   He's   not   happy   like   the photo.   Some kind   of   ennui.   He stares   ahead,   lost   in   thought,   lost   in something.   Outside   the   car   is   all   searing   light   and   blank   brown Australian   landscape. He stares   ahead   listlessly   a while,   then   opens   the   car   door   and climbs   out.  EXT. KHMER DINER   -   DAY  Eric   heads   over   to   a   scrappy   roadside   diner.   The   diner   has   a big dirty   sign   out   front   in   Khmer/Cambodian   script. The walk   is   blinding.   The   surrounding   area   is   desolate.   The   diner stands   alone,   a   dirty   nowhere   stop   on   a   stretch   of   traffic-less road. Eric   wears   an   old   button-down   shirt   with   sleeves   rolled   over   knee- length   shorts   and   dirty   trainers.   He is   wiry   thin.   He has   short- cropped   hair   and   a   goatee   ruling   over   a   three   day   growth.  INT.   KHMER DINER   -   DAY  Eric   steps   into   the   dark   and   musty   diner.   A Cambodian   pop   song   plays on   the   stereo.   It's   really   unnecessarily   loud. (CONTINUED)",

The   other   two   watch   Eric close   as   he   enters.   One has   a   shotgun   resting   across   his   lap. Eric   crosses   to   a   rear   bathroom.  INT.   KHMERDINER/   BATHROOM -   DAY  Eric   cups   his   hands   into   a   bucket   of   water   beside   a   dirty   sink   that has   long   ago   had   its   faucets   removed.   He drenches   his   face.   He brushes   his   teeth   roughly   with   his   finger   and   rinses   his   mouth   with one   cupped   handful   from   the   bucket.   He spits   the   water   into   the sink. He dries   his   face   with   his   shirt   sleeve   and   looks   at   himself   in   the mirror.   His   self-examination   is   strangely   detached.   Something broken.   Something   dark   and   hard.  INT.   KHMERDINER   -   DAY  Eric   walks   back   through   the   diner.   The   Cambodians   watch   him,   wary but   calm.   Eric   meets   their   eyes.   The   air   is   inhospitable   but lethargic. Eric   takes   a   seat   at   the   counter.   He reaches   over   and   helps   himself to   a   tall   glass   of   green   tea   from   a   big   chrome   thermos. He sits   here,   in   the   din   of   pop   music,   sipping   his   tea. He sits   with   his   back   to   a   big   picture   window   behind   him   looking   out onto   the   desert   and   empty   road   out   front   of   the   diner. And then,   barely   audible   over   the   stereo,   a   CAR comes   cart-wheeling across   frame,   outside,   across   the   window   behind   him. It's   a   huge   and   ferocious   CRASH. One of   the   Cambodian   guys   stands.   The   sleeping   guy   stays   sleeping   on the   bench.   The   standing   guy   moves   towards   the   door,   not   sure   what   he saw.   The   other   one   follows,   they   exchange   a   few words   in   Khmer. Eric ",

And then   a   little   Aboriginal   kid   enters   from   a   back   room.   He eyes Eric   suspiciously. The   room   is   dank   and   dimly   lit   with   a   low-watt   fluorescent   tube. ERIC I   need   a   room. KID OK. The   kid   runs   off   behind   the   counter   and   through   a   door   leading   into a   dark   hall. Eric   looks   around.   The   only   sign   of   decoration   is   a   big   old   map of Australia   stuck   to   the   wall,   yellowed   and   frayed.   Eric   studies   it from   where   he   stands.   He looks   at   it   close   -   east   coast   cities, desert,   tropical   north.   Everything   on   the   map seems   so   far   away, from   another   time. The   kid   re-enters   the   reception   area.   Eric   turns   from   the   map. KID   (CONT'D) You gotta   pay   me. ERIC How much? KID USA eighty   for   one   night. ERIC You take   Australian? KID USA money. Eric   looks   at   the   kid,   contemplates   arguing   the   price   and   currency, decides   against. He pulls   his   depleted   roll   from   his   pocket   and   peels   off   80.   He puts it   on   the   counter. The   kid   hands   him   a   fat   room   key. (CONTINUED)",

Eric   points   to   the   map on   the   wall.   The   kid   clambers   up   on   an armchair   underneath   it. KID It's   not   written   on   this   here·,   but it's   somewhere   like   this   place. He points   with   a   little   grubby   finger   to   a   spot   somewhere   in   the vast   eastern   half   of   the   map. Eric   takes   a   look   where   the   kid   points. He lifts   the   kid   down from   the   armchair   and   heads   for   the   door.  INT.   MOTEL   ROOM -   NIGHT  The   door   unlocks.   Eric   opens   it   and   holds   it   open.   Reynolds   enters the   room. Eric   stands   at   the   door,   scouring   the   street   outside. Reynolds   lowers   himself   onto   one   of   the   two   single   beds   in   the   room, wincing   slightly   with   pain,   as   Eric   closes   the   door   and   latches   it. ERIC You're   gonna   start   talking   to   me. REYNOLDS What? (CONTINUED) CONTINUED: ERIC Don't   fuckin   'what'   me.   You're   gonna   talk. Now. REYNOLDS But   I   told   you   I   can't   tell   you   nothing more   than   I   already   told   you. ERIC I   don't   care   what   you   think   you   already told   me.   You're   gonna   talk.   And you're gonna   do   it   now. REYNOLDS But   I   can't. Eric   steps   fast   across   the   room. 51. He heaves   Reynolds   off   the   bed   and   slams   him   against   the   wall, holding   him   by   his   shirt   and   throat. ERIC Where   are   we? Reynolds'   face   contorts   in   pain. REYNOLDS Don't. ERIC Where   are   we? REYNOLDS What? ERIC Where   are   we? REYNOLDS I   don't   know. ERIC I   don't   know either.   So how are   we gonna find   o",

His   eyes   open.   And then   he   sits   up,   startled. 57. Reynolds   is   curled   asleep   in   the   next   bed,   under   the   covers. ERIC Wake up. Eric   gets   off   the   bed   and   pulls   his   T-shirt   on. ERIC   (CONT'D) C'mon.   Get   up.   We gotta   go. Eric   goes   to   the   water   bucket   in   the   bathroom.   It's   practically empty.   He tips   it   over   his   face. He re-enters   the   room.   Reynolds   stirs. ERIC   (CONT'D) Get   up. Eric   takes   his   gun   from   under   his   pillow   and   sticks   it   in   the   front of   his   pants. He moves   to   the   end   of   Reynolds'   bed   and   pulls   the   covers   away. Reynolds   is   fully   clothed   and   curled   up. ERIC   (CONT'D) I'm   gonna   get   us   some water.   When I   get back   you   need   to   be   ready   to   leave.

He lets   his   eyes adjust   and   then   walks   past   other   rooms   that   appear   to   be   unoccupied   -  no   cars   parked   outside   them,   no   sign   of   life. Eric   heads   round   behind   the   motel   to   where   the   Commodore is   parked. He reaches   in   the   car's   broken   back   window   and   pulls   out   two   old   and empty   plastic   water   bottles. He looks   around   to   see   who might   be   watching,   scouring   the   area.   He sees   a water   pump out   the   back   of   building   a   hundred   yards   across   a dusty   and   foul   vacant   lot. He heads   towards   it.  I/E.   MOTEL ROOM-   DAY  Reynolds   sits   up   and   drops   his   legs   over   the   side   of   the   bed.   He rubs   his   eyes.   He looks   sad. He stands   and   goes   to   the   window.   He peers   through   the   venetians   out to   the   street. In   the   street,   he   sees   a   POLICE CAR pull   up   and   stop   in   the   street outside   the   motel,   across   the   car   park. Startled,   Reynolds   steps   away   from   the   window.   He is   suddenly panicked. He goes   to   the   bathroom.   A small   half   open   window   sits   above   the sink.   Reynolds   contemplates   it   a moment   then   goes   back   into   the room,   looking   around   anxious. He goes   to   his   dirty   plastic   bag   on   the   floor   and   pulls   a   handgun from   inside   it. He then   crouches   between   the   beds,   the   gun   pointed   at   the   door. A few   tense   and   silent   moments   pass.   And then   there   is   a   KNOCKat the   door. Reynolds   is   frozen   with   fear.   He waits. Then   another   KNOCK. Followed   closely   by   another. Reynolds   squeezes   his   eyes   shut   and   fires   the   gun   at   the   door.   It BLASTS loud   in   the   little   room.

He is   crying.   He looks   up   at   Eric   like   a   scared   and   crazy   little kid. REYNOLDS (through   sobs) I   just   wanted   to   fight.   I   just   wanted   to fight   him. Eric   watches   Reynolds   for   a moment.   Then   he   looks   around   the   room. ERIC We gotta   go. Eric   starts   gathering   his   things   together.   He pulls   blankets   off   the beds. Reynolds   watches   him   do   it. Eric   drags   him   roughly   up   off   the   ground   by   his   shirt. ERIC   (CONT'D) (impatient) Let's   go.   Get   up.  EXT.   MOTEL   -   DAY  Eric   and   Reynolds   approach   the   Commodore   -   a   distraught   Reynolds   a couple   of   feet   behind   Eric,   carrying   his   stuff   in   his   dirty   plastic bag. They   wrench   open   the   car's   doors   and   climb   inside. Eric   fires   the   engine   and   reverses   hard   back   around   the   motel   into its   car   park. He then   slams   into   gear   and   drives   out   onto   the   street,   leaving   the carnage   behind   in   the   heat.  I/E.

The   kid   continues   waving   as   they   approach   and   then   points   off   to   the side. Then   the   WAIL of   a   train's   horn. To the   car's   left   is   a   long   and   dirty   freight   train   approaching   a crossing   in   the   street   ahead   of   them.   It's   too   close   to   outrun. Eric   slows   the   car   to   a   stop   as   the   train   crosses   the   street   before them. The   train   is   old   and   rusted   -   a   long   line   of   heavy   industrial freight   containers   pulled   by   an   old   mean   engine. On the   roof   of   every   third   container,   guys   in   dirty   civilian   clothes -   T-shirts,   jeans,   track   pants   -   sit   cross-legged,   clutching   machine guns   like   a   low-paid   militia   guarding   the   train   and   its   cargo.   They look   down listlessly   at   the   Commodore as   the   train   rolls   past.

Reynolds   looks   to   the   kid. Eric   watches   the   train   pass,   watching   the   machine   guns   on   its   roof. TRAIN BOY (CONT'D) You gotta   give   me money   for   telling   you about   the   train's   coming. REYNOLDS I   ain't   got   no money.
