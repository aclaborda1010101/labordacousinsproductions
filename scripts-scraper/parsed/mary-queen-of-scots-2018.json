It’s perched on the sill of a small window, bathed in grayish, early morning light. A SNUFFER enters the frame and extinguishes the flame. We PULL BACK to see the MAIDSERVANT who has just put out the candle, moving onto the next candle in the long corridor, snuffing it out as well. And onto the next when she HEARS... The ECHO of footfalls and clanking swords. As THREE MEN round the corner she steps back, head bowed, making room for them. Walking briskly toward us are THOMAS ANDREWS (Sheriff of Northamptonshire) flanked by two Earls - SHREWSBURY and KENT. They pass by the Maidservant without acknowledging her.   She watches them go as they round another corner. Andrews and his men arrive at a small door. A GUARD awaits them. Upon their arrival the Guard fetches a set of keys from his belt... EXT. FOTHERINGHAY CASTLE - DAY Establishing - a foreboding, turreted castle rising from the marshland of an adjacent river, surrounded by a moat. We hear the UNLOCKING OF A BOLT as we CUT TO-- INT. FOTHERINGHAY CASTLE - PRIVY CHAMBER - DAY MARY STUART - Queen of Scots, Dowager Queen of France. But we see her from BEHIND - her back to us. And this is where we shall stay for now. Seeing events as she does, following from just a few feet to the rear. She is on her knees in prayer, joined by her CHAMBERMAIDS and an OLDER MARY SETON (the younger version of whom we shall introduce soon), facing a small window which overlooks the landscape we just saw. As the heavy door pivots open, revealing Andrews, she remains in prayer, her back to him. He bows his head, then, with solemnity and respect-- ANDREWS It’s time. Mary stands, as do her Servants. She’s wearing a long, black satin gown. A white cap and laced veil against which her dark, auburn hair is lustrous. It’s her hair that we’re drawn to - since we’ve yet to see her face.",

Meanwhile one of the Maidservants loops a string of rosary beads with a golden cross to a girdle at her waist. Another fastens a gold chain around her neck, from which hangs a medallion bearing the image of Christ as the Lamb of God. EXT. FOTHERINGHAY CASTLE - COURTYARD - DAY From behind. Mary is being led across by the Earls and Guards. She pauses to look up at the sky. The last time she will feel the sun directly on her face. ANDREWS (O.S.) Your grace. She resumes following her escort, who have paused for her. EXT. HAMPTON COURT - COURTYARD - DAY QUEEN ELIZABETH - from behind - walking alone, slowly, as if in a daze. She looks up at the sky, then lowers her head. She begins to sob. We can’t see her tears, but we can see her body shaking. CECIL (O.S.) Your grace. We shift focus to WILLIAM CECIL on the far side of the courtyard. He is her most trusted advisor on the Privy Council - a persuasive, manipulative man who understands the realpolitik of power and wields it well. From behind him, we see Elizabeth quickly dry her tears. INT. FOTHERINGHAY CASTLE - LARGE CORRIDOR - DAY We’re above and behind as Mary strides through a large set of doors, her Ladies, Andrews and Guards in tow. Down the hall a little SERVANT GIRL peeks around the corner to get a glimpse. The MAIDSERVANT from the first scene grabs her by the wrist and pulls her out of view. Mary rounds the corner, taking us to-- INT. FOTHERINGHAY CASTLE - GREAT HALL - DAY A vast room filled with a hundred SPECTATORS. At the far end of the room is a WOODEN STAGE. The crowd parts. She heads directly for the stage, mounts the steps to the platform where two MEN stand waiting for her.  2. Still behind her, from over her shoulder, we can see the crowd staring up, a hundred solemn faces - the KNIGHTS and GENTLEMEN OF NORTHAMPTONSHIRE. There is a low murmuring as a number of men speak in hus",

Elizabeth holds up the mirror and looks at her own reflection. We RACK FOCUS from the mirror to the portrait of Mary in the background so that her blurred reflection and the portrait are side by side in the frame. Elizabeth lets her gaze linger on the portrait for a moment, we RACK FOCUS back to the mirror as she looks at her face once again, then turns and presents herself to her ladies. With a matter-of-fact, discerning eye. BESS Aye. INT. HAMPTON COURT - LONG GALLERY - DAY We are with Cecil and Dudley again-- DUDLEY You should bring it up with her directly. CECIL I have, many times. DUDLEY Then there is your answer. CECIL On all other matters she follows my counsel. I have her trust, but you have her affections.   However much it pains me, I am not above admitting you wield a power I do not. You can succeed where I-- But before he can finish the sentence, the doors to the Queen’s Chamber open, revealing Elizabeth. The COURTIERS bow as they part to form a diagonal path across the room.

They begin to walk along the path, Cecil falling in closely behind them with Bess and the Ladies. A bit of jostling among the Courtiers to be closest to the path. It’s not unseemly - they are Nobles and need to maintain their dignity - but it’s noticeable. As Elizabeth walks, she nods to some, ignores others. Lennox presses forward, Darnley following. As Elizabeth approaches, Lennox makes a show of a deep bow, but it goes intentionally unnoticed by Elizabeth. Lennox tries to recover by appealing to Cecil once Elizabeth has passed, stepping out in front of him. He keeps his volume low so as not to be overheard-- LENNOX My Lord - I would ask our mistress to beseech Queen Mary that I be allowed to return to Scotland as Earl of our ancestral-- CECIL (the gall, full volume) This is not the place. LENNOX (insistent) It would be wise to have a Catholic servant there. My influence would-- CECIL It is your influence which emboldened papists here. This is said loud enough for the entire room to turn its attention to Cecil and Lennox, which is what Cecil wants. Even Elizabeth turns and looks back. Lennox is red with embarrassment. Cecil and Dudley continue on. Lennox looks around and sees all eyes staring at him. Elizabeth exits the room and the crowd begins to dissolve. In low tones to his father-- DARNLEY You humiliate yourself. Without hesitation Lennox turns and slaps his son hard across the face. Darnley reels, stunned. Lennox heads for the exit. Now it is Darnley whom the remaining Courtiers are staring at.  16.",

The chamber is still in the process of being decorated - far more modest in its architecture and furnishings than what we saw in Hampton Court, but still brighter and more luxurious than when we first saw the castle. The Four Marys are staring at Rizzio with admiration, even perhaps a bit of lust. He smiles at Livingston, who looks at her feet while blushing. The other Marys giggle, drawing attention from some of the NOBLES who are waiting in a line to kiss Mary’s hand. Among those passing by is MAITLAND - a high-ranking Noble, diplomatic and innocuous on the surface, but a snake within. He and Fleming lock eyes - an instant attraction. Moray introduces the guests to Mary as they come before her-- MORAY William Maitland of Lethington, Secretary of State. Maitland turns his attention back to Mary. Kneels down and kisses her hand. Next up is KNOX - a Protestant Cleric, severely dressed with an even more severe manner. MORAY (CONT’D) John Knox, Church of Scotland. As Knox bends down to kiss Mary’s hand, Rizzio screeches his bow across the strings of his renaissance violin - a comic sound. Knox turns back to Rizzio with disgust. The Four Marys giggle, and Mary herself cannot help but smile. RIZZIO A loose string. Although this thin excuse does nothing to placate Knox. Moray veers things back to business-- MORAY Let us begin. The Lords sit down on chairs in a semi-circle around the throne. Once they are settled, Mary addresses them in French.

Knox makes a show of standing slowly, resolutely and saying the following words with equally slow resolve. KNOX There is one true God. And therefore one true religion. MARY Such rhetoric incites revolt. KNOX If a Prince strays from God’s will, it is not in doubt that they may be resisted. And in your case, as with all women: their sight is but blindness; their strength, weakness; their counsel, foolishness; their judgment, frenzy. Are we to abide a papist and a woman both? Mary is stunned, but gathers herself to have the last, if shaky, word-- MARY Well then, I perceive that my subjects shall obey you, and not me. And shall do what they like, and not what I command. And so must I be subject to them, and not they to me. Unwavering, and unmoved-- KNOX May I sit, Madam? MARY No. You may remove yourself from this council and my court. A gasp of unease from the other Lords. Knox, with all the pride he can muster--  21. KNOX My council is among the faithful disciples I serve. We have as little need of this court as it has of us. I pray for your soul, Madam. Knox slowly makes for the door, milking his exit. INT. HOLYROOD - HALLWAY - DAY Mary walks briskly with Moray. She can no longer contain her rage - face flushed, speaking as briskly as she walks-- MORAY I beg you to reconsider. He has the trust of the people. MARY Did I not give deference to his faith? MORAY Yes. But we must be delicate. Allegiance does not happen by proclama-- She stops and turns to him, her rage frothing-- MARY And where is his delicacy? That he should speak to a monarch so?
