He picks up his bedside clock which is ticking loudly.  It is 3:37. He looks over at the other side of the queen-size bed. It is still made. He picks a long, blonde hair from the pillow and examines it curiously. There is a noise outside and Ed gets up to investigate. <b>INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT </b> Ed walks through the dark hallway and into the living room of his small house",
