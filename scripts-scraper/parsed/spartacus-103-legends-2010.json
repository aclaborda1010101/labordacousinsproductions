Much   smaller   than   the   Cena Libera,   this   is   more   like   a   dinner   party   intended   to   drum   up business.

The   SLAVE   carrying   it   stops   before   some   GUESTS, offering   up   chunks   of   oily   boar   meat   and   sliced   melon   from within. CRIXUS stands   like   a   chiseled   statue,   sword   in   hand.   A   small   knot of   admirers,   both   male   and   female,   stand   in   awe.   Batiatus approaches   with   MERCATO,   a   well-to-do   man   in   his   50s. BATIATUS Crixus!   Let   good   Mercato   have   a closer   look   at   your   sword. CRIXUS Dominus.

As   they   exit,   Lucretia enters   with   ILITHYIA,   Naevia   several   steps   behind. ILITHYIA The   dust   and   the   heat,   it   worsens by   the   hour.   I’d   yet   be   in   Rome   if it   weren’t   for   the   games.   You   must promise   to   visit   while   I’m   here.   My father’s   villa   is   beyond depressing.   A   hundred   rooms   and   no one   to   occupy   them   but   me. LUCRETIA Don’t   you   have   any   slaves? ILITHYIA Of   course.   I   meant   real   people. LUCRETIA It’s   unfortunate   your   husband wasn’t   able   to   join   you.   How   fares the   Legatus? ILITHYIA In   a   mood.   Since   his   return   from Thrace,   the   Senate   has   become   his mistress.   Her   demands   on   him   are boundless. LUCRETIA Men   and   their   ambitions.   They should   learn   to   appreciate   the finer   things. Ilithyia   smiles   in   agreement,   and   then   notices   the   necklace Lucretia   bought   from   Ramel. ILITHYIA That   necklace.
