The   landscape   looks   like   a   JMW   Turner   watercolor   -   all minty   green   and   pastel   rose   and   yellow   with   a   brilliant white   smeared   around   its   edges. BEGIN   TITLES. EXT.   DREAM   COUNTRY   -   DAY HEAR   a   low   hum:   A   buzz,   really   -   soft,   never   annoying   - like   bees   on   a   summer   day. Suddenly,   a   tiny,   transparent,   flying   creature   zips   into view.   Then   another.   And,   another.   So   small,   so   quick, they   are   barely   visible. More   little   buzzers   come   twirling   in,   poised   against   the backdrop   of   pink   mountaintops   and   lavender   trees. A   BUTTERFLY   NET   rises   into   view. A   little   Golden   Buzzer   is   snagged CLOSE:   on   a   turquoise   Glass   Bottle. The   DREAM   for   that   is   what   the   flying   creature   is   - drops   into   the   jar   and   the   lid   is   screwed   tight. Like   a   firefly,   the   Dream   bats   against   the   emerald   glass trying   to   get   out. It   leaves   smears   of   iridescent   color   as   a   residue   on   the jar's   sides. It   spins   about,   painting   the   inside   of   the   jar   with   a shimmering   patina   of   gold. INT.   ORPHANAGE/KITCHEN   -   NIGHT A   SMALL   GIRL   -   SOPHIE,   nine   or   ten   years   old   - investigates   the   interior   of   a   sad   refrigerator. END   TITLES In   the   background,   in   a   corner   alcove,   several   pre-teen GIRLS   are   clustered   around   a   battered,   desktop   computer. The   Girls   are   ready   for   bed,   in   nightgowns   and   pajamas.  I   ('ON'T'TNTmn'",
