The morning sun streams in through a nearby stained glass window, reflecting rays of gold and topaz and magenta as SEVEN KIDS make their way down a church staircase. Five girls. Two boys. All with small learning bibles in hand. BOY #1 I hear it’s just like a swimming pool. They dip you in, and say the prayer, and then you done. GIRL #1 I don’t know. I practice holding my breath, but I’m scared to have my head under water. What if I need to breathe? GIRL #2 I promise you it ain’t nothing to be scared of. It’s quick. And Pastor right there next to you. GIRL #3 The biggest thing is getting your hair wet up. I got it pressed that same morning and it was wasted soon as I hit that water. I should’ve worn a swim cap, like Mama said. BOY #2 A swim cap? So you can look like you got ringworms! All the girls burst into sweet laughter. GIRL #3 A swim cap, not a ringworm cap! BOY #1 (shrugs) Same difference. GIRL #4 Nuh-uh. You ain’t never seen Esther Williams? The boys give up and head in another direction at the landing.

Interrupted without warning, they all hear something strange and turn in the direction of a LOUD CRACKING. Their expressions questioning the origin of the unfamiliar sound. The answer DETONATES in the next room. The camera SLOWS to follow the girls. Lifted off their feet as BRICKS fly through the air. Striking them. Windows shatter, raining LARGE, SHARP SHARDS. One slicing clean through a petite limb. Gloves now gray with soot, raised in defense of a SPLINTERED WOOD BEAM that crashes down from above. The back of a head adorned with curls smashes against a CONCRETE WALL. The CRIPPLED CEILING buckles, then collapses amidst the DARK SMOKE. Then -- all is silent, except for a HIGH-PITCHED HISS which increases in intensity. We pull back on the room to find FOUR LITTLE GIRLS, laying motionless. Among blood and debris and bibles. Covered in TINY BITS OF GLASS that gleam in that morning sun against their broken bodies.  2. 8FLiX.com SCREENPLAY DATABASE FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY INT.

We honor this man from the Deep South of the United States of America, who has been imprisoned on many occasions, whose home has been subject to bomb attacks, whose life and the lives of his family are constantly under fatal threat, and who nevertheless does not falter in his quest for justice and for freedom. Martin Luther King has spoken of his dream. One which we, and many people across the world, share. To this undaunted champion of peace, the Nobel Committee of the Norwegian Parliament awards the Peace Prize for 1964. For you, sir. Visibly moved, King accepts and steps to the microphone. KING Your Royal Highness, Mr. President, Excellencies. I refuse to accept that mankind is so bound to the starless midnight of racism that the bright daybreak of brotherhood can never be a reality.
