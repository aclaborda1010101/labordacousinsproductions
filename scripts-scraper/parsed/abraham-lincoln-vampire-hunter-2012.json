HENRY Before   we   can   begin,   you   must   cut   this down   with   a   single   swing. Abe   studies   the   trunk. ABE That   tree?   Impossible.   It   has   to   be four   feet   across. HENRY Oh   but   it   isn't   a   tree.   It's   what   you hate   most   in   the   world. (beat) So   tell   me,   Mr.   Lincoln   --   what   do   you hate? ABE (thinks,   then) I   hate   ...   Jack   Barts. HENRY Very   well. (the   tree) Then   strike   him   down. 25. Henry   steps   aside.   Abe   (who   thinks   this   whole   thing   is  stupid)   raises   his   ax   and   STRIKES   --   barely   chipping   bark. HENRY   (CONT'D) Clearly,   you   don't   hate   him   that   much. (a   beat) Tell   me   what   you   hate. ABE (sighs,   then) I   hate   ...   vampires. Henry   motions   to   the   tree.   Abe   SWINGS.   The   blade   lodges   in  the   trunk,   but   doesn't   go   very   far   through   it. HENRY Pathetic!   Tell   me   what   you   hate!",
