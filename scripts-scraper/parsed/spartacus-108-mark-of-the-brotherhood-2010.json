Segovax   is   slammed   off   him   by CRIXUS who   has   just   entered.   Spartacus   collapses   to   the   floor, choking,   gulping   air   in   ragged   breaths. SEGOVAX recovers,   snatching   up   Spartacus’   fallen   scraper   and attacking.   Crixus   attempts   to   avoid   the   makeshift   blade,   is only   partially   successful.   Segovax   swings.   Crixus   blocks   the blow,   catching   Segovax’s   wrist.   A   test   of   strength   ensues   as Crixus   tries   to   force   the   scraper   out   of   Segovax’s   grasp. SEGOVAX   PUNCHES   CRIXUS in   his   stomach   wound,   reopening   it   once   again.   Crixus   grunts in   pain,   but   refuses   to   give   in.   The   scraper   finally clatters   from   Segovax’s   grasp.   Crixus’   fists   rain   down   on Segovax.   One   last   blow   sends   BLOODY   TEETH   flying.   Segovax crumbles   to   the   floor. CRIXUS   FIGHTS   FOR   BREATH, favoring   his   reopened   wound.   Spartacus,   regaining   his senses,   tries   to   speak. SPARTACUS You   kill...   a   fellow   Gaul...   to save   a   man   you   hate? CRIXUS I   do   not   save   Spartacus.   I   save   a brother...   from   an   unworthy   end. Crixus   draws   himself   up   proudly. (CONTINUED) CONTINUED:   48. CRIXUS (cont'd) You   share   the   mark...   You   have earned   a   glorious   death...   at   the hands   of   a   gladiator.
