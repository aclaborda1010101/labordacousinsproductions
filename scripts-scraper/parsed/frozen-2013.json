If we don’t do something soon,  we’ll all freeze to death.  Hans comes in, putting on his most distraught face.  SPANISH DIGNITARY  Prince Hans.  HANS  Princess Anna is...dead.  VARIOUS DIGNITARIES  What...? No.... Mon dieu.  Hans stumbles, weak with grief. The men help him to a chair.  DUKE  What happened to her?  HANS  She was killed by Queen Elsa.  DUKE  Her own sister.  HANS  (really putting it on)  At least we got to say our marriage  vows...before she died in my arms.  He bows his head in a brilliant display of teary grief.  DUKE  There can be no doubt now; Queen  Elsa is a monster and we are all in  grave danger.  SPANISH DIGNITARY  Prince Hans, Arendelle looks to  you.  Hans nods; he knows what he’s being asked to do, and he’ll do  it with the perfect amount of authority and gravitas.  FROZEN - J. Lee   97",

Elsa looks out at the storm that is  devastating Arendelle, then hears the guards approaching.  GUARD (O.S.)  She’s dangerous. Move quickly and  with resolve.  Elsa pulls at her shackles. They crack. Just as the door  busts open, the weight of the ice crumbles the walls. The men  duck out of the way.  Hans pushes his way into the room...sees...  The back wall is blown open. Broken shackles rest on the  floor. Elsa is gone.  CUT TO:  EXT. MOUNTAIN SLOPE — DAY  Kristoff heads into the mountains. Sven lags behind, not  wanting to follow. He looks back at the kingdom, then shakes  his head. Enough.  He runs past Kristoff. Stops and turns to face him. He snorts  and grunts.  KRISTOFF  What is it, buddy?  Sven nudges Kristoff with his antlers.  KRISTOFF (CONT’D)  Hey, watch it. What’s wrong with  you?  Sven snorts with more conviction, moos, brays.  KRISTOFF (CONT’D)  (avoiding)  ...I don’t understand you when you  talk like that.  FROZEN - J. Lee   98 Kristoff tries to walk on ahead, but Sven uses his antlers to  lift Kristoff off the ground.  KRISTOFF (CONT’D)  Ah! Stop it! Put me down!  Sven drops him hard then “yells” at him once more.  KRISTOFF (CONT’D)  No, Sven! We’re not going back!  Sven shakes his head, angrily.  KRISTOFF (CONT’D)  She’s with her true love.  Sven makes an “of-course-she-isn’t” face. Kristoff gets it;  he’s made his point.  Just then the wind picks up. Kristoff looks back at the  kingdom. Sees a violent winter storm swirling over the  castle. Sharp ice claws its way up the castle, encasing it.  KRISTOFF (CONT’D)  Anna.  Without hesitating, he dashes back down the mountain. Sven  runs after him, catches up. Kristoff grabs Sven’s harness and  jumps onto his back.  CUT TO:  INT. LIBRARY — NIGHT  Anna shivers by the door. She looks up to see ice overtaking  the ceiling.  The door handle suddenly jiggles.",

The storm is so strong it  sweeps the window panes away.  OLAF  Slide, Anna.  It’s a long, snowy way down. But what choice do they have?  They slide down the iced-covered building.  Anna arrives at the bottom, weak but uninjured. Olaf gathers  snow along the way. He arrives at the bottom as a giant  snowball.  OLAF (CONT’D)  We made it!  He shakes off the extra snow as Anna struggles to her feet.  EXT. FJORD — DAY  Kristoff and Sven bound off the mountain and sprint across  the frozen fjord waters and right into the heart of the  storm. Its white-out wind pushes them back. But they fight  through.  KRISTOFF  Come on, buddy, faster.  CUT TO:  Anna and Olaf reach the shore of the fjords.  ANNA  Kristoff!  The wind lifts Olaf up and pulls him apart. He goes swirling  off into the storm.

Suddenly, a mangled ship, risen by ice, capsizes over them.  They give it all they’ve got as debris falls all around them  and the mast shatters. They make it past just as the entire  ship slams down and cracks the thick ice beneath their feet.  The ice opens up. Sven bravely jumps over a gap. But it’s too  wide. He bucks Kristoff to safety, but lands in the freezing  water and disappears below.  KRISTOFF (CONT’D)  Sven? Sven!  At first there’s nothing but the wind and the tumbling icy  water. But suddenly, Sven surfaces and claws his way to a  floating ice chunk. He calls out, signalling for Kristoff to  go on.  KRISTOFF (CONT’D)  Good boy.  CUT TO:  Anna moves blindly across the fjord. Anna’s hands frost over  an icy blue. She stumbles on, determined. But she’s running  out of time.  She clutches her chest. The color in her eyes fades, the  inevitable is coming.  CUT TO:  Kristoff, lost in the white-out, doesn’t know which way to  turn. But then he hears a faint--  ANNA (O.S.)  Kristoff.  KRISTOFF  Anna...? Anna!  WHITE OUT TO:  FROZEN - J. Lee   104 Elsa struggles through her own storm, but the fear is  consuming her. A dark shadow approaches. It’s Hans.  HANS  Elsa. You can’t run from this!  Elsa backs away from him.  ELSA  ...Just take care of my sister.  HANS  Your sister? She returned from the  mountain weak and cold. She said  you froze her heart.  ELSA  What? No.  HANS  I tried to save her, but it was too  late. Her skin was ice. Her hair  turned white...  Elsa’s face sinks as she realizes what she has done.  HANS (CONT’D)  Your sister is dead... because of  you.  Elsa drops to her knees, emotionally broken. And with that,  the swirling storm suddenly stops.
