GILFOYLE  Help yourself. Did you finish?  Dinesh searches for a mug.  DINESH  Yeah, I just pushed my code. It took  me two fucking days but I've broken  up our entire codebase into parallel  services.  JARED  Well done.   The journey to a million  users begins with a single multi-  threaded parallelized step. We're not  there yet,   but we'll definitely be  more efficient.

Dinesh has found a MUG and is about to pour coffee into it,  but   sets down the pot and the mug.  DINESH  Oh, I'm sorry. When I hacked together  video chat   as an in-house tool I  didn't realize that hundreds of  thousands of people would shit  themselves   over how great it was.  I'll never   underestimate my talents  again.  GILFOYLE  Don't worry,   I'll continue to do it  for you.  Erlich enters in a bathrobe.  ERLICH  Less talk,   more work boys. With all  respect to   the Jewish people, I'm not  paying you   to   coffee-klatsch   like a  bunch of fucking   yentas .  Erlich picks up Dinesh's mug and fills it with coffee.  GILFOYLE  You're not   paying us at all.  ERLICH  Oh, I'm sorry. Are you the one who's  about to get fucked face-first by  your credit card company with a king-  sized AWS hosting bill?  DINESH  You should   bear a hundred percent of  the company's costs, seeing as you  own a hundred percent of the company.  What the fuck is taking you so long  to give us   our shares?  ERLICH  Recapping a company is complicated,  but Big Head and I are   on the case .  SILICON VALLEY - 401 - GOLDENROD REVISIONS - 2/24/17   7. DINESH  You'd better be. We're not gonna work  for free forever.  ERLICH  So instead   of blowing hot air out of  the holes in your faces maybe you  should cut   down our fat fucking  server costs before we all own a big  chunk of nothing?  Erlich heads off with Dinesh's cup, leaving an empty coffee  pot   on the counter.  DINESH  We just finished. And that was my  coffee...  Richard enters.  GILFOYLE  Hey, the Karachi Kid and I just  finished. I didn't see your commits.  Did you push your code?  RICHARD  Uh, no actually.  DINESH  Well, your   highness, can you please  push that code?

Dinesh and Gilfoyle peer at it, dubiously.  RICHARD  proudly (   )  I started to optimize our code to  handle higher traffic, like we  discussed,   but then it occurred to me  that instead of rewriting our old  code, I could build a new encoder  that doesn’t strip away a ton of  channels and metadata. So I extended  my compression algorithm to support,  get this... twelve bit color.  Dinesh and Gilfoyle stare at him. What the fuck?  RICHARD   (cont'd)  We can now   offer our users ten  percent better image quality with  deep blacks and wide color rendering  and HDR with absolutely no increase  in server load.   Just watch this.

Trying very hard not  to totally   lose my shit here.  RICHARD  I get it, I get it.  DINESH  After every VC in town shut us down,  we decided   the only way to stay alive  until we hit a million users was to  cut our server usage. Remember? The  whole reason Gilfoyle and I just  stayed up for forty-eight straight  fucking hours was because we all  agreed to   decrease   server load. Not  keep it the same.

They won't even be  able to tell the fucking difference!  It’s imperceptible to the human eye.  RICHARD  Well, I'm sorry, but I disagree. I  think we need to make the product  better. And as the CEO, that's a call  that's up to me.  DINESH  You fucking prick.  RICHARD  Woah.  JARED  Guys? Please be civil.  Jared puts both hands out in front of him, palms down, moves  them   up and down, \"squash it.\"  DINESH  I see what's happening here. You hate  the fucking video chat.  RICHARD  Of course I don't hate   the video  chat, Dinesh.  DINESH  You do. You've always hated it  because it   was my idea, so you're  trying to totally rewrite it to make  it all about you. You're fucking  jealous!  JARED  Civil. Civil.  Jared keeps motioning to squash it.  RICHARD  Jealous of   what? You built the video  chat with my algorithm, so whatever  we have here is because of m y  algorithm .  SILICON VALLEY - 401 - GOLDENROD REVISIONS - 2/24/17   10. DINESH  Right. The   same way that when Picasso  painted a masterpiece, the guy who  made the paints and the brushes  deserved all the credit, right?  SILICON VALLEY - 401 - GOLDENROD REVISIONS - 2/24/17   10A.
