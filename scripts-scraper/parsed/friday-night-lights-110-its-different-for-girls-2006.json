JASON I sure did.   Thanks, mom. ANGLE ON his father, peering over the paper, watching Jason eat. JOANNE STREET Uh, Jason, a lawyer’s coming by tonight.   Just to talk. Mr. Street puts down the paper, clearly exasperated. JASON You and dad don’t seem on the same page about this. JOANNE STREET There is no page yet.   This is all about options.   Your father and I are on the same page that we’ll spare no expense when it comes to making you better.   Am I right, Mitchell? Mr. Street nods. JASON Alright, mom.   We’ll talk to the lawyer.

I just met this bangin’ shorty, and I guarantee I’ll hit that ‘fore you cop a feel off Julie Taylor. DOLIA You saying you’ll score on Waverly Grady before Saracen gets second on Julie Taylor? SMASH That’s what I’m saying. PUDNICK I don’t know, Smash.   Waverly was studying in Ghana for a year. She’s real smart, and she don’t give a damn about football.   You might be overreaching. SMASH Nothing’s out of reach to the Smash.   I’m one size fits all. DOLIA You ain’t scoring on the Reverend’s daughter.   I’ll bet Saracen gets second on Julie Taylor before you score.

TAYLOR (addressing the team) It would be a mistake to take a vacation mentality to Friday Night’s game.   It’s not just that we might lose, but that we might not win.   We have a chance here for more than a W.   We have a chance to establish ourselves, to build a reputation.   To put fear into future opponents.   Do not underestimate the power of fear. Coach places his hands on Smash and Saracen’s barbells. TAYLOR (CONT’D) Reputation plus intimidation equals victory.   I want us to go all out this Friday.   No let up.   This is a chance to shine.   I want us to shine. He gently pushes down on the barbells, creating resistance. Smash and Saracen struggle... TAYLOR (CONT’D) Dig deep.   Focus on the game. Focus only on this game.
