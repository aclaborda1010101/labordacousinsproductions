Above   the   bird,   over   the   image,   THERE   ARE   NUMBERS   SHOWING   MINUTES, SECONDS,   THOUSANDTHS   OF   SECONDS   PASSING   BY   -   the   passing milliseconds   are   just   a   blur   on   the   screen. The   timer   nears   one   minute: “00:59.991”...   “00:59.992”... TIME   SLOWS   DOWN.   A   second   now   lasts   10   seconds...   Everything   keeps slowing   down   until   the   bird’s   wings   become   sharper,   more   visible. Things   keep   slowing   down...   NOW,   ONE   SINGLE   MILLISECOND   LASTS   A SECOND.   The   hummingbird   seems   to   float   in   mid   air...   ONE   SECOND (one   thousand   milliseconds...)   has   elapsed   on   the   timer (01:00.000) The   milliseconds   keep   moving   up,   one   millisecond   now   lasts   1 second...   (01:00.001,   .002,   .003) A   single,   isolated   hummingbird’s   wing   flap   starts   it’s   movement, almost   seized   in   time.   It   reaches   its   folded   position   at   ONE SECOND   AND   SIXTEEN   MILLISECONDS. “01:00.016” TIME   FREEZES.   So   does   the   timer.   WE   CREEP   IN   on   those   last   numbers frozen   on   the   timer,   those   16   milliseconds... VINCENT   (V.O.) What’s   your   dream   Anton? ANTON   (V.O.)

And   now   the   shit   is   rising faster   and   faster   ‘cause   with   all   that fluid   coming   out   of   the   tubes,   the   central pump   feels   the   pressure   coming   down   so   it pumps   harder   and   harder...
