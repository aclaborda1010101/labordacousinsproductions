STUDIO   -   CONTINUOUS --where   SLOAN'S reading   from   a   TelePrompTer-- SLOAN --88%   compared   to   last   year   has   its shares   down   nearly   2%   in   early   trades. Internet   giant   Yahoo!   also   seeing   their shares   weaken   this   morning   leading   into-- 24. In   the   background,   through   the   plexiglass,   is   the   still-nearly empty   newsroom. The   studio   itself   has   an   odd   feel   to   it.   The   three   cameras   are robotically   operated   from   the   control   room   so   the   anchor   is the   only   one   in   the   studio,   giving   the   impression   that   the anchor   desk   is   a   lonely   place   to   be   and   that   whoever   is sitting   there   might   well   be   talking   to   no   one.   Off   to   each side,   in   the   shadows,   are   anchor   desks   used   for   other   programs on   the   network. SLOAN (CONT'D) --earnings   reports,   though   Yahoo!   shares have   consistently   outperformed   in previous   quarters. JIM   HARPER,   late-20's,   quietly   enters   the   studio.   JIM   doesn't know that   he's   an   incredibly   good   looking   guy   because   he   saw  \"All   the   President's   Men\"   when   he   was   7   years   old   and   never looked   back.   He   has   an   easy   sense   of   humor   and   he's   confident without   being   arrogant.   He's   here   for   his   first   day   of   work-- dressed   in   a   shirt   and   tie--but   he   knows   SLOAN and   he's stopped   in   to   say   hi. SLOAN (CONT'D) Meanwhile,   AT&T this   morning   posted   EPS before   a   non-cash   charge   of   59   cents   a share,   up   from   53   cents   a   year   ago   and ahead   of   the   Street   at   54   cents.   For   more on   that,   UBS   financial   analyst   Kelly Slade. (irmnediately) Jimmy,   what   are   you   doing   here? A   live   shot   of   a   reporter   on   the   floor   of   the   New   York   Stock Exchange   replaces   the   image   of   SLOAN   on   the   monitor   but   with the   audio   off   only   SLOAN   can   hear   what   she's   saying.  JIM  Mac brought   a   couple   of   us   up   from Washington   to   meet   Will. SLOAN Will?",

SLOAN (back   on   TV)  Kelly,   we're   hearing   reports   today   that Visa's   reached   an   agreement   to   acquire CyberSource   for   26-dollars   a   share   in cash   which   would   be   roughly   two-billion if   my math   is   any   good.   Is   anyone confirming   that?  (back   to   JIM)  What   are   you   talking   about?  JIM  Do you   need   to   concentrate?  SLOAN  (off   her   rundown   sheet) Not   for   another   two   and   a   half   minutes. You're   working   here? JIM With   MacKenzie. SLOAN  MacKenzie's   working   here?!  JIM Doesn't-- SLOAN Thanks   Kelly,   we'll   be   coming   back   to you.   Now shares   of   Goldman   Sachs   rose   2% in   premarket   trading   after   the   bank reported   profits   of   3.5   billion   Tuesday, delivering   a   much-needed   shot   to   the firm's   ailing   reputation   as   it   faces questions   over   its   role   in   structuring security   tied   to   subprime   mortgages.  (MORE)  25. SLOAN   (CONT'D) For   today's   \"Wall   Street   on   Main   Street\" minute   we   go   to   Martin   Wing who's standing   by   with   some   folks   at   Munson's Diner   in   Wheeling,   West   Virginia.   What's  the   special   today   at   Munson's,   Martin?  JIM  Do people   here   not   know what's   going   on? SLOAN I   know   that   Elliot   Hersh   got   10   o'clock, I   know   Don Barrowmen's   going   with   him   and taking   a   lot   of   his   staff-- JIM And Mac's   taking   Will's   show   and   brought her   people   with   her. SLOAN That's   impossible.  JIM  I'm   standing   here. SLOAN This   is   a   soundproof   room   but   if   Charlie Skinner   had   hired   Mackenzie   while   Will was   on   vacation   I'd   have   heard   Will's skull   exploding   from   here.
