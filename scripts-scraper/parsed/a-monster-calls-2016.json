I’ve never been  more sorry about anything in my  life.  ConoR  You said it would work. You  believed it would work.  MuM  I know.  ConOR  You lied. You’ve been lying this  whole time.  MUM  I think, maybe, deep in your heart,  you’ve always known, though.  Haven’t you?  She reaches for him, but he won’t take her hand.  Mum (CONT’D)  It’s okay that you’re angry,  sweetheart. It really, really is.  (rueful laugh)  I’m pretty angry, too, to tell you  the truth. But Conor? Are you  listening, Conor?  202. Conor, still looking away, eventually nods.  MUM (CONT’D)  One day, if you look back and you  feel bad for being so angry that  you couldn’t even speak to me, then  you have to know that it was okay.  That I knew. I know everything you  need to tell me without you having  to say it out loud.  Conor still can’t look at her. She starts crying harder, but  pushes through it.  MUM (CONT’D)  And honestly, son, you be as angry  as you need to be. Don’t let anyone  tell you otherwise. Not your  father, not your grandma, no one.  And if you need to break things,  then by God, you break them good  and hard. And I’ll be right there.  You might not see me, but I’ll be  right there, breaking ‘em right  along with you.  Conor can hardly bear it.  MUM (CONT’D)  I need to know that you heard me,  sweetheart. I need to know, okay?  Okay?  Without looking at her, Conor finally nods his agreement.
