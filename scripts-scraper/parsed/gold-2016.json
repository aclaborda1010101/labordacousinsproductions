Suddenly WILD BOAR let out a chorus of squeals and scatter into the brush, and there, splayed on the river bank, we find-- A BODY. One of the soldiers approaches -- the stench is palpable -- the body already decomposing. The soldier finds a wallet, checks the ID -- we don’t see the identity. The Soldier speaks into his radio.

PROSPECTOR SUITE - MORNING  The Sierra Nevada out the windows. It’s fall. SUPER OVER --   RENO, NEVADA - OCTOBER, 1988  Wells facing Jennings, listening. JENNINGS I think it’s pretty unlikely we’ll ever see your partner again. WELLS Wait, what do you mean? You’re not telling me something. What happened to Mike? JENNINGS A lot of very powerful people are very angry at Michael Acosta. WELLS What happened!? Jennings searches Wells's face again for a trace of the disingenuous. JENNINGS  What happened ? Yes. That’s what we’re trying to put together.  120.  (MORE) Off Wells -- PRE-LAP: The sound of HELICOPTER ROTORS, growing louder.   Deafening... SMASH TO:  EXT.

First, he’s locked out of the assay lab in Kalimantan by The Minister of the Interior. So he goes back to Jakarta.  EXT. JAKARTA INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT - DAY  Acosta emerges from a plane and walks down the gangway stairs. JENNINGS (V.O.) Where he is immediately detained by Indonesian Military. Waiting for him at the bottom are INDONESIAN SOLDIERS. OFFICER (subtitled) This way Mr. Acosta. JENNINGS (V.O.) And they hold him while they try to reproduce for themselves the lab results claimed by Washoe.  INT. INDONESIAN MILITARY BARRACKS - DAY  Acosta watching men march in formation through a doorway. JENNINGS (V.O.) Which of course they are unable to do.  121.  JENNINGS (CONT'D)  Seventeen billion dollars of value disappeared overnight. That is certain. What else?

JENNINGS And at this point either he’s being moved to an actual prison, or he’s bribed one of the officers. Either way, he’s on a military helicopter.  INT./EXT. HELICOPTER - FLYING - DAY  Acosta sits in the hold of the chopper, two soldiers across from him, a pilot and another SOLDIER up front, all armed. JENNINGS (V.O.) They fly north loosely tracking the Kensana river. The chopper arcs in, following the river’s course. Acosta stares out, far into the distance, taking in the breathtaking beauty. JENNINGS (V.O.) Do not underestimate the Suharto family. They are gangsters whose turf is a nation of 100 million. Acosta in the back of the chopper. He’s got a six-pack of Tuborg Gold in cans. He cracks one, holds the others out to the soldiers, who decline. He drains the beer. He looks down at the river as it passes far below, flashing gold in the sunlight, a snaking golden river, golden dream -- Hands suddenly undo his harness. An involuntary breath. Then a smile creeps onto his face. Acosta now at the open hatch door of the chopper. Tighter on his eyes taking it in. He’s coming home. IN SILENCE MIKE ACOSTA FALLS FROM THE HELICOPTER Falling and falling and falling toward canpoy and water --  122.",

He faked it. Or he paid just to have the story out. (desperate) 164 million goes a long way in Indonesia... JENNINGS (beat) They found a body. WELLS Are you sure it’s him? JENNINGS I’m not sure of anything, except Mike Acosta traded water filters for river gold, but now the Indonesian government has gone unusually quiet on the subject and seems to have, publicly at least, lost all interest in finding Michael Acosta.  EXT. INDONESIAN JUNGLE - DAY  THE CRANE SHOT of the INDONESIAN MILITARY and DAYAK in semi- circle around the SPLAYED BODY. One of the soldiers breaks ranks and moves forward, kneeling by the body. What he sees there sickens him --  123. JENNINGS (V.O.) Hands and face were eaten away. Probably by wild pigs. BANG. All heads whirl. The BIG SNAKE FALLS. Floats down river. The soldier finds the wallet, flips it open, checks the ID. And this time we see the name -- MICHAEL ACOSTA. And a picture of MIKE ACOSTA, smiling. JENNINGS (V.O.)
