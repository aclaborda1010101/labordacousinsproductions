Two   black-on-black   Audi   Q7s   with   tinted   windows   pull   up   in front   of   the   station.   Three   MEN   step   out   of   each   SUV   and surveil   the   area:   the   PEDESTRIANS   passing   by   on   the   sidewalk, the   traffic   in   the   street,   even   the   rooftops. None   of   the   six   bodyguards   is   particularly   large,   they   don't have   razor   scars   on   their   faces,   their   scalps   are   no   longer shaved--   but   even   if   you   didn't   know   they   were   ex- paramilitary,   you   would   know   enough   to   step   out   of   their   way. When   the   bodyguards   determine   the   area   is   safe,   one   of   them opens   the   rear   door   of   the   second   Audi.   An   older   man,   COLONEL BORZ   (55),   steps   out   of   the   SUV. Still   wiry   and   fit,   his   blue   eyes   fierce   as   a   wolf's,   Borz has   the   authoritative   bearing   of   a   man who   has   been   giving orders   for   thirty   years. He   marches   toward   the   station,   his   six   bodyguards   forming   a loose   phalanx   around   him.   The   protection   is   quiet   and efficient--   a   casual   observer   wouldn't   even   notice   Borz   and his   guardians. As   the   Serbs   head   inside   the   train   station,   a   decidedly   non- casual   observer   follows   twenty   paces   behind.   MONROE,   a   young American   (25)   dressed   like   a   college   student   on   a   semester abroad,   has   the   Time   out   guide   to   Belgrade   in   his   hands. He   wears   a   Bluetooth   earpiece   and   speaks   quietly. MONROE They're   in   the   station. EXT.

He   also   wears   a Bluetooth   earpiece. Henry   has   been   fighting   in   one   war   or   another   for   just   as long   as   Borz,   but   he   doesn't   have   the   rigid   demeanor   of   a career   soldier.

The   bodyguards,   ever   vigilant   to   potential   dangers,   guide their   commander   to   an   outdoor   platform   where   last-minute stragglers   jump   aboard   the   Belgrade-Vienna   train   \"Avala.\" Borz   and   his   men   step   into   one   of   the   First   Class   cars.

A YOUNG   COUPLE   has   already   claimed   two   of   the   seats.   The boyfriend   plays   his   girlfriend   a   song   he   likes   on   his   iPod and   she   bobs   her   head   in   time   to   the   music. They   look   up   when   they   see   the   ex-paramilitary   men   staring down   at   them.   For   a   tense   moment   nobody   says   a   word.

His   bodyguards   sit   around   him, watching   everyone   who   passes   by. Monroe   takes   a   seat   at   the   far   end   of   the   car.

There's probably   a   story   about   the   watch   but   you're   not   going   to   hear it.   He   peers   out   the   windshield,   looking   for   something. 3. EXT.
