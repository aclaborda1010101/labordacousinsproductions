She reaches a deserted spot where three donkeys stand on the right side of the road. The woman pulls over, puts on a pair of gloves, gets out of the car, checks to see if there is anyone nearby or if she is being watched, runs towards the donkeys, shoots one of them many times over, runs back to the car and drives away.  OPENING CREDITS. I. THE TOWN INT. TOWN HOUSE SITTING ROOM - MORNING 2  A MAN around 45 years old, DAVID, sits on a sofa. His WIFE, around 40 years old, stands and leans against a bookcase. David is shortsighted and wears glasses. His wife also wears glasses. Next to David lies a DOG, an Alsatian. David is crying. The woman is not. DAVID’S WIFE I’m really sorry. (Pause) DAVID Does he wear glasses or contact lenses? DAVID’S WIFE Glasses. (Pause) David doesn’t look at her. He stares at the floor. He swivels a glass of grapefruit juice on the table with his hand. David’s wife seems sad. She looks at her watch a couple of times. She hesitates, but finally talks. DAVID’S WIFE (CONT’D) You’ll have to hurry up. They'll be here quite soon. David leaves the room. As he goes up the stairs to the bedroom, his wife keeps talking to him. DAVID’S WIFE (CONT’D) Don't worry. I'm sure you'll find the right woman really soon. A woman of average shortsightedness,  just like you.",

His movements are slow and unhurried, as if he doesn’t want these final preparations to end. He stares at his slippers next to the bed. He decides not to take them with him. FEMALE V.O. He decided that his brown leather shoes were the best pair to wear. He went down the stairs into the sitting room. There he saw the other man for the first and last time. He was very handsome.  INT. TOWN HOUSE SITTING ROOM - MORNING 4  David goes down the stairs that lead to the sitting room. In the sitting room sits a MAN who is not handsome. He too is shortsighted and wears glasses. He eats a tuna-mayonnaise sandwich. FEMALE V.O. He was eating a tuna-mayonnaise sandwich and wearing a pair of black lace-up shoes. She was in the kitchen. David sat in the armchair and looked at his watch. His wife entered the room and left a glass of Coca-Cola Light for the man eating the sandwich and then went to the window.  INT. TOWN HOUSE SITTING ROOM - MORNING 5  David sits in the armchair. The two men do not look at or talk to each other. The woman enters holding a glass of Coca- Cola with ice and a slice of lemon. She leaves the glass in front of the man eating the sandwich and then goes over to David. She looks at her watch and then out the window. Everyone waits in silence. They all avoid making eye contact. David grabs a coffee table book from the coffee table next to him. He flicks through the pages quickly, looking at the pictures without any real interest. He just goes through the motions. The dog sits next to him. FEMALE V.O. David picked up a book called “The Most Famous Lighthouses in the World” and pretended to read. He was thinking his wife didn’t love him at all anymore. He didn’t burst into tears and he didn’t stop to think that the first thing most people do when they realise someone doesn’t love them anymore is cry.  2.",

TOWN ROAD - MORNING 6  The waiters lead David to a coach. The dog follows them and gets into the vehicle with David.  EXT. HOTEL COACH - MORNING 7  There are another four people sitting on the coach. Two WOMEN, a BALD MAN and a BLOND MAN. They all sit in different parts of the coach. David takes a window seat.  3. The waiters sit together behind the WAITER-DRIVER. One of the two women gets up from her seat and goes over to where David sits. She looks at the dog and smiles at him but does not stroke him. She looks a little afraid of him. She strokes the dog above his hind legs, as far from the animal’s mouth as possible. BISCUIT WOMAN Your dog is so beautiful. What’s his name? DAVID Bob. BISCUIT WOMAN Hello, Bob. I’m Anna. I love dogs so much. I’m sure Bob senses this and knows that we’re going to get along famously. I’ve heard the journey takes over an hour. I’ve got butter biscuits and hazelnuts in my bag. I can give you some if you’re hungry. I mean, we can share them. I can give the dog some hazelnuts too, or a biscuit.

The waiters have automatic rifles slung across their backs. The hotel is a large building surrounded by a tall fence. It looks quite well-maintained and clean. The plants are in excellent condition and it is immediately clear that this is one of those large hotel complexes that can accommodate a large number of guests. At the entrance, the flags of various countries fly on tall poles. A number of people stand and watch from the room balconies. One of them waves. Biscuit Woman, filled with optimism, waves back. The passengers get off the coach. The two waiters lead them to the entrance in a line. Blond Man is slow and falls behind because of his limp. We will call him LIMPING MAN from now on.  II. THE HOTEL NEAR THE TOWN INT. HOTEL LOBBY - DAY 10  The hotel lobby is empty. There is nobody around apart from the RECEPTIONIST. On the walls are various classic-looking paintings, all of which show couples in a characteristic pose: the man seated in an armchair with the woman standing by his side. There are also some paintings, again in a classic style, of animals, such as a horse, a duck or some other bird. The receptionist is a young woman with a friendly face and a calm voice. Biscuit Woman and the other woman, David, Limping Man and the Bald Man stand in front of the reception desk. RECEPTIONIST Welcome. Have any of you stayed in the hotel before? BISCUIT WOMAN I have. RECEPTIONIST Excellent. Then you know the rules. If you like, you can wait in the lobby. You’ll find today’s papers, and we can bring you tea or coffee or a soft drink. BISCUIT WOMAN I’d like to hear the rules again, if you don’t mind. I mean, it’s been ten years since I was last here and I’ve forgotten a number of things. Like the bit with the days where you hunt the people in the woods with a bow and arrow, the night of the slaughter and so on.  5.",

You can sort this out amongst yourselves. The gentlemen allow the ladies to go first.  INT. HOTEL LOBBY - MORNING 11  David is the last to be served. He keeps hold of the Alsatian with one hand and rests his other hand on the reception desk. The dog seems anxious, and barks. David tries to calm it down but doesn’t succeed. The dog barks throughout the exchange that follows. RECEPTIONIST Well, sir, you said you’ve never been on your own before, correct? DAVID No, never. The receptionist fills in a form. RECEPTIONIST Are you allergic to any foods? DAVID No. RECEPTIONIST Your last relationship lasted how many years? DAVID Around twelve.  6. RECEPTIONIST Do you remember how long exactly? David tries to calm and quieten the dog but fails. DAVID Eleven years and one month. RECEPTIONIST Any children? DAVID No. RECEPTIONIST And the dog? DAVID My brother.

Okay, now I’d like you to write your name clearly on this form. She hands him the form to fill in. RECEPTIONIST (CONT’D) In capital letters. We see the golf course and squash courts, empty.

David walks quickly, trying to find an empty table to sit at. Everybody looks at him as he walks by. He looks straight ahead the whole time. All the men wear the same clothes. All the women do too. They all sit alone. There is only one chair at each table in the room. He sees Limping Man, who was with him on the coach. He too has his arm tied behind his back. All the new arrivals wear this same accessory. FEMALE V.O. His first day was one he would never forget so long as he lived. Beside the window opposite his table at breakfast sat a young woman with her head tilted back. Later he would learn that she often got nosebleeds. Next to her sat her best friend. Near the door, the woman who was with him on the coach offered a biscuit to a man drinking a Campari and soda for breakfast. He then looked behind him and saw a man and a woman he would meet in due course, and some others he would never meet during his stay at the hotel. We see NOSEBLEED WOMAN, her BEST FRIEND who stares at her, Biscuit Woman (with one hand tied behind her back), CAMPARI MAN, LISPING MAN and HEARTLESS WOMAN, characters we will get to know later. Lisping Man is around 50 years old and Heartless Woman is around 35 and very beautiful. David spreads butter and marmalade on a slice of bread with one hand and eats. Limping Man and Lisping Man come up to his table. LIMPING MAN I’ve decided to go for a walk outside with my new friend. Let me introduce you. This is Robert, he stays in the room next to mine and has a lisp. David puts down his cup of coffee and offers his hand to Lisping Man. They shake hands. DAVID Pleased to meet you. I’m staying in Room 101. LIMPING MAN Would you like to join us? DAVID Why not.  14.",

LISPING MAN She’s much older than he is, you know that right? DAVID Yes. LIMPING MAN Yes. LISPING MAN When Melanie was with Don, I could understand what brought them together clearly. He was more her age and their hair colour really matched as they were both strawberry blond. But now with Antonio it’s really strange, it doesn’t really make sense. I mean, he’s much darker than she is and, as you know, much younger. LIMPING MAN Maybe there’s something we don’t know. I’ve heard he has his own business, he sells this aftershave, you know, named after himself. DAVID Maybe she has an aftershave or a cologne named after her too. LISPING MAN Maybe. I don’t know. What I do know is that these two are a shining example to us all. Whenever I feel down, I think of these two and tell myself that I’m going to make it, that everything’s going to be alright. I keep hold of this thought and I know that my days at this place are numbered. One of these days it’s going to be me on one of those three yachts.  INT.

HOTEL MANAGER Room 206, Day 2. LIMPING MAN Hello, everyone. LIMPING MAN (V.O.) (CONT’D) My mother was left on her own when my father fell in love with a woman who was better at maths than she was. She had a postgraduate degree I think, whereas my mother was only a graduate.  EXT. ZOO - DAY 22  We see Limping Man walking normally, without a limp, in a zoo and holding a carrier bag. He passes various caged animals and reaches the wolf enclosure. He takes pieces of raw meat out of the bag and throws them into the enclosure at various places. The wolves draw close. LIMPING MAN (V.O.) I was sixteen at the time. My mother entered the hotel but didn't make it and was turned into a wolf. I really missed her. I found out she'd been moved to a zoo. I often went there to see her. I'd give her raw meat, I knew wolves liked raw meat but I couldn't figure out which of the wolves was my mother, so I used to give a little bit to each of them. Limping Man climbs up the enclosure fence. The wolves come over to where the man is. Only two wolves stand motionless and watch from a corner of the enclosure. LIMPING MAN (V.O.) One day I decided to enter the enclosure. I really missed her and I wanted a hug. I climbed the fence and jumped in. All the wolves charged at once and attacked me. All but two, who stood motionless. My guess is that one of those two must have been my mother. The zoo guards got to me quite quickly and took me to the hospital. Thankfully I didn't lose my leg, I just have this limp, which is also my defining characteristic.  16.  (MORE) My wife died six days ago. She was very beautiful and I loved her very much. She had a limp too. We see a zoo guard hosing down the blood in the wolf enclosure. A tiger sleeps in the next cage. INT. LECTURE HALL - MIDDAY 23  The audience applauds. Some stand.

HOTEL MANAGER And yet it has been brought to my attention that you continue to do it.   [To the Maid]   Had he ejaculated when you found him? MAID We don’t know.

BASKETBALL COURT - DAY 49  David holds a bag of golf clubs and watches a couple playing basketball one on one in the court from behind the wire fence. They’re having fun, they yell and kiss. David is fixated by them. FEMALE V.O. When I was at the hotel, I never much left my room. Hardly ever. I went there around four years ago. From the very first day I knew there was no one there who interested me. I used to listen to a lot of French music back then, and no one else listened to French music there. I stayed for 19 days. I let a waiter fuck me in order to help me escape. After he’d fucked me he said that he wouldn’t let me go and that I’d better just go back to my room and quick. I killed him and left. I also killed a resident who tried to stop me leaving because he said he liked me.  EXT. HOTEL GROUNDS - DAY 50  David heads back towards his room carrying golf equipment. He sees a crowd of people.

He thought about kicking her in the stomach over and over again and then stabbing her in the same spot, in the stomach. But then he thought that there wouldn’t be much point because she was already unconscious and so she wouldn’t feel any pain from the kicks or the knife.

THE WOODS - MORNING 66  Loner Swimmer, aided by a BANDAGED LONER with bloodied bandages over his mouth, gives David a waterproof cape, a portable CD player, a pocket-sized game of solitaire, the book “Of Mice and Men” by John Steinbeck and a knife. David realizes that he’s going to be a proper member of this group. As these changes are taking place David acts in a mechanical way, without really thinking where all this will lead him. He looks at Bandaged Loner. There’s fresh blood on his bandages. DAVID What’s wrong with your mouth? LONER SWIMMER He can’t talk. He was given the Red Kiss. DAVID What’s the Red Kiss? LONER SWIMMER We slashed his lips with a razor and the lips of another loner and we forced them to kiss each other. That was a few days ago now but the cuts were deep and they’re still in pain. They were flirting, you know. Check if the portable CD player works properly otherwise I’ll have to find you some new batteries. Davis presses play on the CD player. Music plays. He pushes the stop button. DAVID It works just fine.  EXT. THE WOODS - MORNING 67  David takes off his t-shirt and rubs Tiger Balm cream onto his upper back, as far as he can reach. He cannot reach most of his upper back properly.  EXT. THE WOODS - MORNING 68  Loner Leader watches a pig eating some weeds. She creeps up without making a sound and slips a lead around its neck. They start walking in the woods. Wherever the animal stops, the leader digs into the ground with her hands as if looking for something. She then gets up, wipes the soil off her hands and continues walking the pig.  47.",

That was the first time I saw him. He was exercising three rows behind me but because I’m shortsighted, I couldn’t see him clearly. In any case, he seemed quite presentable. We see a woman, whom we’ll soon get to know as SHORTSIGHTED WOMAN, exercising and looking at David. David does what the others do, a little confused but determined at the same time. FEMALE V.O. (CONT’D) The next day, in town, I found out that he was shortsighted too, just like me and I knew for sure that he liked me. That night, in my sleep, I dreamt that we lived in a big house together in the town with a large, well-lit kitchen and I was wearing dark blue trousers and a tight cream blouse and he took my clothes off and fucked me up the arse and as he was fucking me a thug came into the kitchen and took the steak knives from the second drawer and attacked us, stabbing the knives into our bellies one by one. I woke up terrified. The loners then form a line and start jogging through the woods. A LONER gets caught in a foothold trap. He screams. The others stop but don’t help him. They talk amongst themselves and give him advice on how to free himself. David watches. Shortsighted Woman stands behind him. LONER LEADER Try harder. Pull the trap open with your hands. Positive thinking is everything at times like this. Don’t give up. You know, you should’ve been more careful. Try harder. Or they’ll find you and you’ll be turned into an animal. A weak one. The other loners laugh. LONER LEADER (CONT’D) We must get a move on now. It’s really too dangerous to stay here. The hotel guests could be here any minute.  48.  (MORE)",

THE WOODS - MORNING 70  David hides and hears the sound of people running and guns firing. He tries to cover himself with leaves, moving slowly and quietly, and smears mud on his face. Silly little things out of inexperience and despair. Despite his efforts, he is quickly discovered by Lisping Man, who takes aim at David with his tranquilliser gun. David puts his hands up. LISPING MAN What you did to that woman was dreadful. I can’t understand why you would turn her into a dog and then kick her to death. DAVID She killed my brother. I would have done the same thing if she’d killed you. You’re like a brother to me. You’re my best friend in the whole world. LISPING MAN I don’t believe I’m your best friend in the whole world. You used to spend a lot more time with the man with the limp. DAVID That doesn’t matter. We didn’t speak much but we both knew that in a pinch we’d be at each other’s side. Did the man with the limp make it? David is not very convincing. But Lisping Man mellows. LISPING MAN They’re getting ready for the pier. It all begins next week.  49.

The doctor’s hands are shiny and clean, like the hands of most doctors. DOCTOR This operation is what we call “routine surgery”. It has a 90% success rate, so there’s no need to worry. There are no scalpels involved, the entire procedure is done by laser. There’s no reason why you shouldn’t see clearly when you’re swimming in the sea or when you first wake up in the morning. Contact lens solution, contact lens cases, eyeglasses, all that will be a thing of the past. LONER LEADER Thank you very much, doctor. Shortsighted woman doesn’t speak.

I understand you’re upset by the unexpected results but to accuse me is very insulting to say the least. The doctor said there were some unforeseen complications after your surgery. That is all. Who would have guessed such a simple procedure could have such catastrophic results? No one. Anyway, what reason could I possibly have had to do such a hideous thing on purpose?
