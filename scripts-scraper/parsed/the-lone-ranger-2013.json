Emerges   from   the   shadow   of   a   large   boulder,   just   as,   several feet   away,   a   Native   American   WARRIOR   also   appears,   also creeping   forward,   on   the   far   side   of   the   boulder. Each   man   becomes   aware   of   the   other   at   the   EXACT   SAME   TIME Faster   than   the   eye   can   follow,   Reid   draws   his   gun   and   the warrior   notches   an   arrow   and   draws   his   bow VERY   CLOSE   ON:   the   arrow's   SILVER   ARROWHEAD   glinting   in   the sunlight.   Sharp,   bright,   rock   steady,   PULL   FOCUS   from   the arrowhead   TO   REVEAL: TONTO. Bold   face   paint.   Muscles   tense   in   their   deadly   coil.   No craziness   in   the   eyes,   instead   a   dark   sanity,   eyes   that   have stared   unflinching   into   the   vast   empty   places   of   the   world. Tonto   wears   clothing,   jewelry   and   feathers   from   many   tribes. Black   war   paint   asymmetrical   across   his   face.   And   above   his head   glitter   the   dozen   silver   arrowheads   of   the   arrows   in his   quiver,   a   kind   of   bright   halo. Reid's   body   is   tense,   his   eyes   intense,   but   his   voice   relaxed and   casual.   He   manually   cocks   the   double-action   colt. REID A   bullet   travels   quicker   than   an arrow. Tonto   gives   that   a   second's   thought TONTO A   fast   death   is   easier   to   face   than a   slow   one. Reid   is   surprised   at   Tonto's   eloquence. REID Death   is   death,   either   way. TONTO That   depends   on   the   life   you   have led. A   quick   smile   from   Reid   at   that. REID Ease   the   bow. TONTO A   dead   hand   lets   fly   an   arrow,   but   a dead   'hand   cannot   pull   a   trigger. 25. Reid   allows   his   eyes   to   leave   Tonto   for   just   a   second,   as   he takes   in   the   surroundings. REID You're   alone   --   or   I   wouldn't   still be   talking.
