THE HOSPITAL - A ROOM - CONTINUOUS  John slowly approaches the figure lying in bed: surrounded by  machinery, accompanied by the soft sounds of technology.  He removes the wilted daisies from the vase, tosses them in  the trash, and replaces them with fresh ones.  He pulls over a chair, reaches out, and takes Norma’s hand:  she is comatose, her breathing synthetic... so many  machines... so many wires, tubes, and monitors.  We never see her face:   just her silhouette.  He holds her hand for a long moment in heavy silence.  3. Behind him, the DOCTOR -of a similar age to John- enters,  placing a hand on John’s shoulder. John lowers his head, and  nods.   With a bit of effort, he stands, staring down at her  for a long moment, never once releasing his grip, and leans  over to kiss her on the forehead.  JOHN  ...it had to be you...  (a long beat, then)  ...be seein’ ya’...  A beat... and John nods.  The doctor turns off the machine; lights dim, the roo",

JOHN’S HOTEL ROOM - CONTINUOUS  A half-eaten meal is scattered upon the table, the bottle of  wine half-empty.  Resting upon the bed, the briefcases lie open, revealing a  veritable armory of dismantled weapons, numerous clips, and  boxes of ammunition.  Sitting at the desk, John pauses from cleaning a pistol to  empty the wine into his glass.   Once done, he pulls back the  slide, studies the pistol with a keen eye, releases it,  carefully loads a clip with bullets, and slides it into the  pistol:   locked and loaded.  From a small wooden case, John selects a SILENCER which he  screws onto the pistol.   He sets it down next to a pump-  action sawed-off SHOTGUN, a SNIPER RIFLE, an old school UZI  SUBMACHINE GUN -silenced- with a polished mahogany stock, a K-  BAR DAGGER, and another pistol.

The grenade from Luga’s gun FIRES into the shed.  BOOOOOOOOOM!   -- the entire shed EXPLODES! Wood and fire go every which way. 95.\n\nLuga watches the blackened pieces fall from the star-lit sky, then goes over to see what remains of Mike and Marcus. But there are no remains. Only charred wooden planks. Luga looks out at the river. Their bodies must’ve been blown out to the river. He waits there a moment, staring out. Sees nothing. An Albanian hitman says what all is thinking. HITMAN  They’re dead.  But Luga refuses to take that for an answer. He grabs the machine gun out of the hitman’s hands and opens fire on the water -- FURIOUS. Screams at the others to: LUGA  Get some lights now!  The gunmen focus flashlight beams on the water. Luga wants to see bodies -- but all he sees is BLACKNESS. Convinced that they’re dead -- that no one could’ve survived that blast or stay under water that long -- Luga turns and leaves -- ROARING AWAY in a nearby speed boat. Another moment passes -- then Mike and Marcus appear from under the water -- sharing the oxygen in the SCUBA TANK. Moments later, the two collapse on shore, exhausted. Marcus turns to Mike, appreciative. MARCUS ...Thanks. Mike nods. MIKE Luttrell set us up. Marcus spits out some salt water. MARCUS Well, I’m definitely down for beatin’ his ass. You? The two get to their feet -- as we GO FAST TO: INT. LUTTRELL’S HOME - NIGHT The front door EXPLODES OPEN! Mike and Marcus RUSH inside. They look around, but the house is EMPTY. No Luttrell. MARCUS He’s gone. 96. Mike tries to find a clue,   any clue , but there’s NOTHING. MIKE Shit! Mike’s phone rings. He puts it on speaker. MIKE (CONT’D) Go. INTERCUT: INT. MIAMI-DADE P.D.

She   is   going to   say: \"Is that   you there, all alone   under that   ceiling booming   and   vibrating   under   the   feet of   the   dancers?   Why   are   you   there,   all alone? And why not somewhere   else?” Yes,   this   is   the   dangerous,   lucid hour. Approaching   the   stage, we   hear the audience   chanting   \"Colette\" over   and   over   in   rhythm.   The   sound   gets louder, the audience’s feet beating a   tattoo   on the floor;   COLETTE, COLETTE,   COLETTE. INT.   THEATRE   – BACKSTAGE 192   192  COLETTE (V.O.) Now, whenever   I   despair, I   no   longer expect   my   end,   but   some bit of   luck, some   commonplace   little   miracle which, like   a   glittering   link, will mend   again the necklace   of my   days. Colette   takes   a   deep   breath.   The   curtain   goes   up,   to   thunderous applause.   She   walks   into   the   brilliant glow   of the footlights, and disappears   into white,   like a   bird   disappearing into   the sun. TITLES comes   up,   accompanied   by   ARCHIVAL   PHOTOS   and   MUSIC. TITLE In   1911, Colette’s   “The   Vagabond,”   based on her   music   hall   experience,   was   published under   her   own   name   to   great critical   acclaim. TITLE   (CONT’D) Missy   and   Colette   continued   their   relationship for   many   years.   Missy often   accompanied Colette   on   her   music   hall tours,   though   never again   opted to   appear   on   the   stage. TITLE   (CONT’D) Willy   continued   to   publish   ghost- written books   with   Meg, but failed   to replicate the success of   the Claudines. He   died   in   1931   in   relative   obscurity.  TITLE (CONT’D) Paul Héon did not destroy the original Claudine manuscripts but returned them to Colette. They became crucial evidence in a 1948 legal battle to establish the true authorship of the novels... that Colette won.  COLETTE - FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT   121. TITLE   (CON",

MOMENTS LATER- We find Adonis in the corner, doing step and punch on air, next to the six year old fighter, and a couple of other young BOXERS. He looks over at Leo working drills, envious. EXT. PHILADELPHIA STREET- NIGHT 42   42  Adonis walks down the sidewalk, looking around, questioning if he made the right move coming out to Philly. As he approaches a building, he sees a line of hipsters, mostly black standing outside. Hip- Hop music plays from inside. He keeps walking: not his type of crowd, but as he passes the window, he sees that stops him in his tracks. He looks back at the line, and heads towards it. The camera tracks over to reveal a large flyer with a photo of Bianca on it. INT.

BIANCA This last song, is for anyone who has ever had their heart broken.  26. The HOUSE BAND starts, and Bianca closes her eyes, moving to the beat. She sings, with a beautiful edge to her voice. Adonis watches her closely, she opens them and they seem to catch eyes. INT. PENN CAFE- MOMENTS LATER 44   44  Adonis watching the musicians packing up. We see his POV: Bianca giving the guitarist a hug. She walks over to the bar, and the BARTENDER hands over her purse from behind the counter. ADONIS Wussup, neighbor. Bianca looks up and sees Adonis, recognizing him immediately. She turns back to her purse. Putting the pack of cigarettes back inside. BIANCA Workout boy. I thought that was you.

EDDIE (VO) (CONT’D) It was not what you’d call a textbook landing, but I couldn’t have been happier. The local kids wince as they find Eddie writhing amid the remains of a smashed green house. EDDIE (VO) (CONT’D) I was on my way. Part of the big show, admired and appreciated for who I was. Eddie is helped to his feet, badly cut and covered with broken plants. LOCAL KID Fucking maniac!  INT. BEDROOM - DUSK  EDDIE (VO) And then came the bombshell. Eddie lies on his bed reading   Moments of Glory,   like he does every night. A boy alone under his Evel Knievel poster. TERRY (OS) Eddie! Get down here now!  INT. KITCHEN - DUSK  Janette and Terry sit at the Formica table, bewildered and exasperated at this crazy son of theirs covered in scratches and cuts. TERRY Enough’s enough. You're spending your holidays with me down at the site. It’s time you learn the plastering trade. Eddie digests this like a death sentence, knee bouncing up and down. 6. EDDIE What about my Olympic preparations? Terry says nothing. Just picks off some debris from Eddie’s sweater. Eddie looks to Mum. But she has to agree with Dad. JANETTE You never know, pet, you might like it.  EXT. HILL TOP - NIGHT  Eddie sits with his bike, gazing out over the lights of Cheltenham below. EDDIE (VO) So that was the sporting career of Eddie Edwards. Down below him is a dirty noisy building site — his future. EDDIE (VO) (CONT’D) Eleven different sports and nothing to show for it except twelve pairs of broken glasses. (I sat on my sixth pair in the library.) He scratches his knees absently as his defeated face slips into darkness. The crushing despair that only a 10-year-boy can feel. We hold. Long enough to feel this could be the end of our story... and it probably would be except for the blaze of white light that suddenly illuminates the sky.

It’s mostly entrance fees and a bit of travel — TERRY But more than you can afford. Eddie doesn’t deny it. Terry picks up a Prince Charles salt shaker. TERRY (CONT’D) Well, answer me this.

Just like the ones in the hall closet.  INT. LIVING-ROOM - NIGHT  Terry and Janette sit by their pewter Flickerflame gas fire in matching armchairs. TERRY So he’s no better off than when he left, is he? JANETTE Like that’s going to stop him. She wants to go back to her knitting but can’t. He wants to go back to his copy of   Plasterer’s Monthly , but can’t either. JANETTE (CONT’D) We’re just going to have to face it. He’s an obsessive. Terry grunts. TERRY Yeah. I wonder where he gets that from. He looks at her   surrounded   by shelves of royal china. JANETTE Yeah. I wonder. She looks at him   surrounded   by swirly stucco walls and ornate brickwork.  INT. HALLWAY - DAWN  Eddie carries his gear to the bottom of the stairs. This time, Janette and Terry are both waiting for him. JANETTE If we can’t stop you, at least we can support you. 52. She holds out a check, which catches Eddie completely offguard. EDDIE ... You don’t have to do this. TERRY That’s what I said. Janette throws him a look. Turns back to Eddie. JANETTE Just come back in one piece. Eddie sees the amount on the check and reacts. It’s sizeable. Janette pushes the check into his hand.

Peary watches Eddie lift his hot metal cup to reveal five interlocking rings in the iced platform. EDDIE (CONT’D) I’ve never changed my mind since.  EXT. BOTTOM OF THE 70M - NIGHT  The clang of unsteady feet as Peary and Eddie descend the stairs. They get to the bottom. A pause. Peary has something to say too. He puts an arm around Eddie’s shoulder. PEARY Eduardo , mein freund . I’ll get you your moment. Off they weave, down the slope to the lights below.  EXT. MOUNTAIN - DAY  Music swells as we sail over a snowy mountain road.

Before he can decide what to do he  hears Siri’s car PULL UP outside. Car doors OPEN AND SLAM.  JOSH (O.C.)  I’m just saying, it’s an objective  truth: The Japanese are the most  whacked-out people on earth.  Josh and Sarah tumble in the dining room. Siri’s behind them  with a BAG OF GROCERIES.

Mo  quietly watches.  ZEKE  ...It’s like in King Kong when the  monkey has got the chick in his  hand and he is throwing her around.  Yea, she is scared but she is also  super turned on, because- this is  what I am saying - girls like to be  thrown around when you are having  sex. They like somebody that’s  going to pick them up and throw  them up against a wall or on the  bed.

Robin spins the hoop, starts swinging his hips, but he can’t get the knack. ROBIN Harder than it looks. MARY DAWNAY Just imagine you’re jiving. Robin tries again. Diana looks on, smiling, one hand on her bump. Robin staggers slightly as he swings his hips. The hoop drops to the ground again. ROBIN Too much tennis. He turns to Diana.

You know theaters these days --  GREG  Oh, sure --  JOSH  -- they’re so dirty, and they’re either  too hot or too cold, and there’s always  people talking, which is just --  (his phone buzzes)  -- just so annoying, I mean you’re trying  to watch a movie -- one second --  (opens phone)  Hello?...  His Fiancée smiles, looks at Greg and Mia, proud.  FIANCEE  Probably work.  JOSH  Yeah, I’ll have to call you back.  (closes and pockets his phone)  So, yeah, we love it.  Awkward silence. Mia hasn’t spoken a word.  EXT. RIALTO MOVIE THEATER - NIGHT 52  Sebastian paces. People shuffle in. He looks. No sign of Mia.  INT. JAR - NIGHT 53  Midway through the meal.  Mia is bored, restless, uneasy.  JOSH (CONT’D)  One word for you. Nicaragua.  GREG  I’ve never heard anyone say that. Was it  amazing?  Revision   35. JOSH  Oh my God. A five-star jungle eco-resort.  It was unbelievable.  Mia stays quiet, in her own thoughts, the voices around her  fading away. And then she hears it -- coming from the  restaurant speakers, peeking out subtly at first: the melody  we now know so well...   Her and Sebastian’s song.  She FREEZES. The radio music seems to have morphed into the  melody, and the tune stirs something deep within her...  A few seconds pass. And then she can’t deny it any longer.  It’s clear as day to her now. She rises from her seat --  GREG  Mia?  -- looks at Greg --  MIA  I’m sorry.  -- and -- as the sounds of a FULL ORCHESTRA swoop in --  -- RUNS out of the restaurant as fast as she can.  EXT. JAR - NIGHT 54  The MUSIC SWELLS, strings carrying us through and lifting  Mia’s spirits as she runs down the street in her green dress,  for once absolutely sure of what she’s doing...  INT.

It’s Mia and Sebastian’s song.  Mia looks at Sebastian. He looks at her, then back at his keys.  This is the most beautiful we’ve ever heard his playing. The  most tender, and full of emotion, it has ever sounded.  We MOVE CLOSER on Sebastian. We recognize this image. It  recalls the visualization of his dream, back at the RESTAURANT  that night in winter, years ago. Gradually, as Sebastian  plays, his surroundings seem to grow DARKER.

ADAM glances at her, a hint of insecurity flashing across his brooding eyes. ADAM Am I? EVE looks forward, smiling, her eyes again bright and irrepressible. CUT TO: EXT. ADAM’S CAR - NIGHT The car moves through a completely deserted post-industrial area.   It turns again, pulling down a narrow alley, which then widens into an open area partially enclosed by broken factory walls.   The ghosts of old machinery stand rusting and collapsed.   The Jag slows, then stops. Its headlights illuminate a very large corroded metal tank, a rusting metal staircase leading to a platform near its rim. In the surrounding area rusting barrels are tossed here and there, leaking small pools of strangely colored liquid chemicals. EVE (surveying the landscape through the windshield) Delightful. ADAM turns and checks behind him, then switches off the headlights, leaving the engine running. CUT TO: EXT. ABANDONED INDUSTRIAL AREA - NIGHT Together ADAM and EVE drag the tarped body from the car toward the large chemical tank. EVE Is this like in BATMAN, when they throw the Joker into the acid? ADAM Yeah, sort of, only he was still alive. Suddenly an eerie sound causes them to freeze.   Not far off a group of coyote howl and yip uncannily.  77. EVE Tell me I’m crazy, but those are most definitely Canis Latrans. ADAM Yeah.   Coyote. EVE Interesting.   In the heart of Detroit? ADAM You’d be surprised. The sounds subside, the coyote moving off.   ADAM and EVE resume, dragging the corpse to the staircase at the base of the tank.   They carry it up the staircase, seemingly without difficulty, indicating prior experience in the physics of moving corpses. Reaching the platform at the top, they pause and peer into the tank, reactively covering their mouths and noses.   Three or four meters below them is a surface of thick, oily, liquid emitting a visible vapor.   EVE glances at ADAM. ADAM (cont’d) Don’t even ask.   (pause) You ready? They hoist the wrapped corpse to rim",

(pause)   What we’re going to do is calmly get the hell out of here. Suddenly the doorbell rings.   Both freeze momentarily, then ADAM rushes to the window.   Pulling the curtain back very slightly, he peeks out.   The bell rings again. Outside he sees the same group of young hipsters who rang his bell earlier.

MOONDOG (shrugs his shoulders like a spoiled child) OK. The judge stares long at hard at Moondog. JUDGE I was a real fan of your writing. MOONDOG Oh yeah? JUDGE It amazes me that someone who writes so beautifully can be so crude and reckless. 66. Moondog looks proudly over his shoulder at his homeless friends sitting in the back of the courtroom.

An old WORKBENCH cluttered with family PHOTOS from ages ago. April glances at a POLAROID of a   TEENAGE GIRL : braces, dark eyes, beautiful. She’s hugging April. They’re both laughing. The Polaroid seems to be attached to a PAINFUL MEMORY. And like everything in this basement, it has the look of something that was abandoned long ago. A HAND TOUCHES APRIL’S SHOULDER. John is standing behind his daughter. April doesn’t look over. Doesn’t react. If we hadn’t noticed before, we realize now that there is an enormous amount of tension between them. April’s face starts to quiver. Tears filling her eyes. She pushes her father’s hand away and leaves. John opens his mouth as if to say something, but of course... he can’t.  EXT. VALLEY - MORNING  John has a LARGE DUFFLE slung around his shoulder. He leads Will down a steep trail into a lake valley. As they walk, we may or may not notice how they always: 1) Avoid dry leaves and sticks 2) Walk heel to toe 3) Distribute their weight evenly 4) Keep their arms close to their sides 5) Breathe steadily 6) Match the cadence of each other’s gait  EXT. LAKE - MORNING  Will sits into a small ROW-BOAT with no paddles. He hides his trembling hands. Doesn’t want his father to know he’s scared. John sits behind him and gazes at the placid water. A layer of RED ALGAE covers the entire basin. It is thick and milky along the shore, where the SKELETONS of cows, horses, and fish waste away. 6. There’s a long ROPE that extends from one side of the lake to the other. It’s been secured to a post on each end and pulled taught, hanging no more than a few inches above the surface. The men begin pulling themselves along the rope, slowly at first; careful not to disrupt or splash the water in any way. Their boat glides across the calm lake, gaining momentum, heading to a SMALL GROVE OF TREES on the other side.  EXT. WELL",

He loves this; he’s attracted to a hapless, helpless Norman, to whom he can be superior.   But crucially, this weakness, this neediness, the pills, turn him on.   They give Jeremy control. And at the same time: Norman, by being helpless, and simply by being young, is giving out sexual signals.   It’s not deliberate, it’s innate; it’s how he gets through the world. NORMAN These pills are new.   I was on Largactil, but they said try this Elavil instead.   Because I wasn’t very well.   In the head.   I suppose you’d guessed that already!   I was in the clinic.   For psychiatric patients.   Is that all right? JEREMY Of course it is. NORMAN And they were very go",

JARED Do you believe in God? XAVIER Serious. JARED Why is that serious? Jared is buoyed by drink. It is a bold side of him we have never seen. Perhaps some things are possible with booze that otherwise are not, as we may remember from Jon’s tale. Like with that - this encounter should carry an edge that carries the possibility of that same danger. JARED (CONT’D) Do you believe in God or not? Your whole art thing is -- XAVIER I do. I was raised with religion and I question it, but I still believe in God  91.  (MORE) JARED Who created the earth? Xavier laughs. That’s a BIG question? XAVIER You like a little small talk, huh?

Don’t they cancel each other out. XAVIER Well, paper beats rock. Then no one can believe in God. JARED Why? XAVIER Because science has shown itself and God has not. JARED Sure he has.

CASA SANTA MARTA - OUTSIDE BAC K OFFICE - DAY 82   82 The Nun knocks on the door of the office. There is no reply. Lawrence steps forward and knocks more loudly. After a moment, the door opens a little and SISTER AGNES peers out. LAWRENCE Good afternoon, Sister. I need to speak to the nun who dropped her tray just now. SISTER AGNES She is safe with me, Your Eminence. I am dealing with the situation. LAWRENCE I am sure you are Sister Agnes.   But I must see her myself. SISTER AGNES I hardly think a dropped tray should concern the Dean of the College of Cardinals. CONCLAVE by Peter Straughan - Pink Revisions. (27.01.2023) 71.\n\nLAWRENCE Even so... He grips the door handle. Amazed, he finds that as he pushes, she resists. SISTER AGNES The welfare of the Sister is   my  responsibility, Dean. An impasse as both stare at each other.

CONCLAVE by Peter Straughan - Pink Revisions. (27.01.2023) 72. She opens her mouth to protest again but Lawrence turns and stares at her with a look of such freezing authority that she finally bows her head and walks out of the room, closing the door after her. Lawrence sits, facing SISTER SHANUMI. LAWRENCE   (CONT’D) Sister Shanumi, I want you to understand, first of all, that you are not in any sort of trouble. The fact of the matter is, I have a responsibility before   God to make sure that the decisions we make here are the right ones. Now it’s important that you tell me anything that is in your heart and that is troubling you in so far as it relates to Cardinal Adeyemi. Can you do that for me. Shanumi stares at the floor, shakes her head. LAWRENCE   (CONT’D) Even if I give you absolute assurance that it will go no further than this room? Again, she shakes her head. Lawrence   sits, at a loss. Then, inspiration strikes. He leans towards her again. LAWRENCE   (CONT’D) Would you like me to hear your confession? INT.

The child was brought up in a Christian household, and to this day he has no idea who his father is - if indeed it is me.  That   is the child. For a moment the two men stare at each other in silence, Adeyemi’s jaw jutted in defiance. Then something in him crumbles. He sits on the bed. ADEYEMI   (CONT’D) (Beat. Broken) We were very young.

Last week’s discovery in Eugene, Oregon provided tragic new evidence to support that claim. Brian Fakler brings us up to date.  EXT. COSTCO - DAY 107B   107B  BRIAN FAKLER This Costco is just one of thousands of big-box stores around the country that import almost a million tons of goods weekly, most of it from Asia. Last week workers here in Eugene opened a suspicious TV box and discovered seventeen downsized stowaways from Vietnam, fourteen of them already dead, two more dying hours later at a local hospital.  INSERT - RECYCLED PRESS CONFERENCE FOOTAGE 107C   107C  POLICE display the BOX   in question.   One stained bottom corner is perforated with tiny holes punched out for air.  BRIAN FAKLER (V.O.)  On Friday, the lone survivor, a 45- year-old woman named Ngoc Lan Tran, was transferred to a hospital at Leisureland Estates in New Mexico, widely considered the country’s top medical center for the small. Doctors were forced to amputate a portion of an infected leg, and today her condition is described as fair but stable.  INSERT - “B-ROLL” FOOTAGE 107D   107D  Ngoc Lan Tran is transferred from a helicopter to a medical team outside Leisureland.  52 BRIAN FAKLER (V.O.)  Yesterday, U.S. officials were able to question the woman for the first time.   According to a statement from the Department of Homeland Security, Ms. Tran claims to have been jailed for her environmental and political activism and, along with dozens of other dissidents, was miniaturized against her will in a Vietnamese prison facility.   If true, this would bolster accusations by human rights groups that repressive governments around the world are forcibly downsizing scores of prisoners and political undesirables.

ALEX (to security) Get him out of here. ROD I’ve not done   this   but it’s my line of work so to speak. ALEX Get him out. Michael stops walking and looks at Rod’s kind, open face.

You’re in there. (pointing to Michael’s head) Everything else is out here where it can’t touch you. All of this is miles away. And you can travel further, in your head. Fly into yourself. You’ll feel shame: just ride it, like a wave. It’ll help carry you. Michael nods. ROD (CONT’D) At the end of the day, you’re saving a life.

Jesse raises his gun and --  SCRREEEEEEEEH!   Tires squeal nearby.   The Bulletheads turn  just a moment too late and --  RRRRRRROOOOOOOOOAAR!  HOLY SHIT!   A vehicle SCREAMS out of nowhere, PLOUGHING into  the drug dealers!   A gut-turning CRUNCH of metal on flesh.  BREAKING BAD #312   \"Half Measures\"   AS BROADCAST   54.  (CONTINUED)\n\nThe Bullethead with the Oakleys slides UNDER THE TIRES.   The  vehicle actually rises slightly as it CRUSHES his sternum.  The other guy FLIPS over the vehicle’s hood and goes FLYING.  He hits the concrete face-first and lies there, limp.  Jesse is frozen in place.   The vehicle is...   WALT’S AZTEK .  Walt gets out of the Aztek and quickly scans the area for  witnesses.   As far as he can tell, there’s no one out there.  We didn’t see him but during Jesse’s confrontation with the  Bulletheads, Walt was parked nearby, watching from the  darkness.   Getting involved wasn’t a calculated move -- if  he’d had time to think about it maybe he wouldn’t have done  it at all.  But when he saw Jesse walking into a gun fight, Walt’s  instincts took over.  Walt glances back -- the guy under the Aztek’s wheels is  twisted at a weird angle.   Blood pools around him.  Definitely dead.   But...   SCRAPE-SCRAPE .   What’s this?  The second Bullethead is MOVING.   His automatic landed about  ten feet away from him and he’s painfully inching his way  over to it.   The danger’s not immediate; at this rate he’ll  be there sometime after the next Summer Olympics.  Walt goes over to the automatic and picks it up.  With tremendous effort, the wounded Bullethead heaves himself  over onto his back.   His face is a mess; landing on the  concrete was like rubbing sandpaper on Jell-o.  Walt stares down at him.   He knows what he has to do.  Without taking his eyes off Walt, the Bullethead pulls  himself halfway up to a sitting position.   The drug dealer’s  mouth is moving, he’s struggling to say something.   Maybe  he’s trying to threaten, maybe plead for mercy.   No way to  tell, all he can make are saliva bubbles.  Jesse hasn’t budged since Walt arrived.   He’s watching, wide-  eyed.   His automatic dangles at his side, forgotten.  No half measures .   Walt grasps the Bullethead’s automatic and  stands over the drug dealer.   Is he really going to do this?  The Bullethead stares straight at",

He’s wearing a nightgown himself, and a knitted nightcap. EDWARD Emily. Are you awake. EMILY (sitting up) Yes, Father. 40. EDWARD May I come in? EMILY Yes, you may.

EDWARD (CONT’D) I’d hate to think that you were angry with me. She says nothing. EDWARD (CONT’D) You just - you can’t know how I worry about you children. He looks at her.

Promise me, okay? EMILY Promise you what? EDWARD Promise you won’t get married and move away. Edward clutches Emily’s hand, and stares at her through his tears. It’s touching, though deeply strange. EMILY I won’t leave you, Dad. 41. He smiles. EDWARD Oh, that makes me happy. Keep the family together, that’s what I say. Don’t let it get torn apart.

TIME CUT: Now Ted delivers his closing statement... TED Ladies and gentlemen, the prosecution opened this trial by arguing this case is about more than murder.   I’d like to close it by making that same argument. There are two ways for the police to investigate a crime.   They can go to a crime scene, look for clues, and follow those clues to their logical conclusions.   Or, they can begin with a suspect, decide on a suspect, and work to make the evidence fit",

It’s RAINING heavily outside now, and his window is  covered with condensation. His clock reads 11.34.  He draws KONG on the skyscraper. It’s good. He FLIPS THE  PAPER OVER and draws BI-PLANES on the back. He holds it up to  the desklamp. He flicks the light on and off, making the  planes appear and disappear, like they’re firing shots (Sound  Effect: “Ratatatatatata” leading us to sound of nightmare).  Then he draws Kong falling. He gets lost in it, and the sound  of the NIGHTMARE rises again. This time, we even see flashes  of it:  32. NIGHTMARE 24A   24A  --FLASH OF TWO PAIRS OF HANDS locked in a ferocious grip,  as if one is trying to keep the other from falling.  Conor keeps drawing, almost furiously.  33. NIGHTMARE 24B   24B  --FLASH OF VIOLENT MOTION, dark and burning.  Conor keeps drawing, as the soundtrack intensifies. He  doesn’t notice a breeze tousling his hair or the pencils  rolling across the desk again.  34. NIGHTMARE 24C   24C  --FLASH OF A DISTANT FIGURE ON A CLIFF’S EDGE, calling  out, “CONOR!!”  Soundtrack ceases as he sits back and blinks at the  sketchpad. He’s drawn a GAPING HOLE OF BLACKNESS that looks  as if it might swallow the whole world. A face - possibly  HIMSELF - stands at the edge of it, looking back up to us.  He suddenly hears hurried footsteps in the hall. They rush  past his room to the toilet. We hear his mum being brutally  sick. Conor waits. She vomits again.  ConOR  (calling to her)  Do you need any help?  Mum (o.S.)  (beat, forced cheer)  No, sweetheart!  Beat, then water running. Footsteps. He covers the nightmare  with the Kong drawing and quickly moves back to his bed. She  opens his door.  CONOR  You okay?  Mum  I’m kind of used to it by now.  Sorry I dozed off during the film.

It shifts and splits, twisting slowly, incredibly,  into the shape of a TOWERING MAN:  --two muscular arms made from branches twining together.  --a second leg placed down beside the trunk.  --the uppermost branches gathering into a great and terrible  face with huge, monstrous eyes.  Conor watches, amazed, but not overly afraid...  THE MONSTER, huge and impressive, strides across the rail  line, over Conor’s back fence and stands up in front of him.  MonSTER  Conor O’Malley.  The voice echoes and booms. The Monster suddenly FALLS  against the house, its hands on either side of Conor’s  window, lowering its head to peer inside.  40. The Monster pushes against the house. It creaks under the 3D   3D  Monster’s weight.  MonstER (CONT’D)  I have come to get you, Conor  O’Malley.  Conor  (beat)  So come and get me then.  Monster  What did you say?

Why don’t you run for your mother?  Conor looks surprisingly defiant at this. He stands and  closes his bedroom door, as if to protect his mum.  CONOR  (surprisingly defiant)  You leave her alone! I’m not afraid  of you!  A beat, as the monster, impossibly, looks surprised-  And disappears.  41. Then it ROARS and PUNCHES an enormous fist through Conor’s 3E   3E  window, taking out a large section of the wall.

MUM  (snorts)  Well, you know how she feels about  your father. Don’t listen to her.  Beat, silence. Conor braces himself.  CONOR  There’s something else, isn’t  there?  Mum quickly, forcefully, cuts off his worry.  MuM  Look at me, son.  He does.  Mum (CONT’D)  The latest treatment’s not doing  what it’s supposed to. So they’re  going to adjust it, try something  else. That’s all.  ConoR  That’s all?  111.\n\nMUM  (nodding)  That’s all. There’s lots more they  can do. It’s normal. Don’t worry.  CONOR  You’re sure?  MUM  I’m sure.  CONOR  Because... You could tell me, you  know.  And here’s the moment, where she could tell him everything.  But she can’t, not yet.  MUM  I remember when you were a little  baby, and it was just the two of  us. And you’d get, like, a fever or  something. I used to get so scared.  I was really, really young - only  six years older than you, if you  can believe it - and this was a  time when things weren´t going so  great. Your dad was gone and I  wasn´t speaking to your Grandma.  And I kept thinking, What if I get  this wrong? It´d be the middle of  the night and I wouldn´t know what  to do, I´d have no one to ask, no  one to lean on. And do you know  what I’d always do? I’d look into  your eyes, into your little baby  eyes, and I’d say, “We’re a team,  me and you. We’re in this  together.” And I’d still be scared,  but it didn’t matter so much  anymore. Because you were counting  on me, and that was the only thing  that mattered.  (rubs his head)  Still is.  She leans up, puts an arm around him, her head on his  shoulder. They both look out at the tree.  MUM (CONT’D)  I’ll bet that old tree will keep an  eye on the house for us while  you’re at your grandma’s.  Conor’s expression is priceless. His mum grabs him and turns  him to her, faux-serious.  112. Mum (CONT’D)  But for God’s sake, whatever you  do, don’t touch your grandmother’s  clock.  Cut TO:  113. EXT./InT. Grandma’s DRIVEWAY/sitting room - days later 66-66A   66-66A  The face of Grandma’s prize grandfather clock. It’s against  the wall of a pristine sitting room, every surface clean and  museum-like, including glass display cases with figurines,  low bookcases, porcelain knickknacks. The polar opposite of  Conor’s warmly untidy house. Conor leans on the doorframe.  Grandma very carefully SETS HER WRISTWATCH by the clock (not  vice versa).

FERRARI - DAY 4   4  The eye belongs to a 27 year old Formula 1 RACING DRIVER  wearing a fireproof balaclava...  Highly intelligent, he also happens to be World Champion. His  name is painted on the side of his Ferrari. NIKI LAUDA.  NIKI (V/O)  My grandfather always said history is  cruel and reductive and no matter how  long we live, or how much we achieve -  we are remembered for very little. So  make sure it's the right things.  NIKI stares up at the clouds. His eyelids flicker. Thinking.  Agonizing. Wrestling with an all important decision...  Is it going to carry on raining? Or become dry? Should he be  using slicks or wets?  EXT. STARTING GRID - DAY 5   5  We widen to find ourselves on the starting grid of a major  Grand Prix. All around us...  1  (CONTINUED)\n\nEngines scream into life as DRIVERS start their cars. An  OFFICIAL walks through the cars holding aloft a sign, “One  Minute”...  Deafening, angry thunder as engines rev impatiently.  NIKI  This is bullshit. We have no control  over our legacy. We cannot choose what  we are remembered for...  A Ferrari MECHANIC rushes towards NIKI, and shouts in Italian  above the noise, (we see sub-titles)...  MECHANIC  Mass usa slicks. Le vuoi cambiare  anche tu?  ( Mass is going on slicks. You  want to change? )  NIKI looks in his wing-mirror back to see a red McLaren, white  helmet, number 12, several rows behind him. A team of  MECHANICS hastily changing the tyres to dry tyres.  NIKI  Otherwise I wouldn’t be remembered for  my rivalry with this asshole. And the  1976 season.  NIKI then looks over at the car in pole position beside him.  Another McLaren, but with number 11, and a Union Jack...  NIKI  What about Hunt? Has he changed?  MECHANIC  No, he’s going on wets.  The car in pole position: JAMES HUNT, surrounded by TV crews,  mechanics, girlfriends, hangers-on..  The Maclaren team is less than half the size of Ferrari’s, but  HUNT makes up for this with magnetism. The rock star of F1.  NIKI’s face: a stab of envy seeing a flash of his rival’s  glamorous long blonde hair disappearing into his balaclava,  flirting with several hot-looking GIRLS..  NIKI  I don't know why it became such a big  thing. We were just drivers. Busting  each other's balls. To me this is  perfectly normal. But other people saw  it differently.  2  CONTINUED: 5   5  (MORE)  (CONTINUED) That whatever it was between us went  deeper. And changed us both somehow.  Forever.  NIKI stares, then...  NIKI  Be, allora usiamo anche noi quells da  bagnato.  ( Then we go on wets, too. )  The ten-second board is held up.  NIKI pulls down his visor...as he and HUNT’s eyes meet for a  split-second, eyes staring...  NIKI selects second gear for the wet track and revs the  engine.

Okja the piglet SQUEALS in the foreground. CUT TO: The car is crashed in the woods on the steep incline bordering the road.

It kneels  down and speaks into his ear.  MonSTER  It is time for the third tale.  Without looking back, Conor starts to walk after Harry. The  Monster matches him, step for step.  MONSTER (CONT’D)  There was once an invisible man,  who had grown tired of being  unseen.  MoNSTER (CONT’D)  It was not that he was actually  invisible. It was just that people  had become used to not seeing him.  ConOR  (to Harry)  Hey!  Conor quickens his step. The Monster keeps up.  Conor catches up to Harry and grabs him by the shoulder,  twisting him around. Harry pretends to not see him, pretend-  blaming a laughing Sully for grabbing him.  MONSTER  One day, the invisible man couldn’t  stand it anymore. He kept  wondering: if no one sees you, are  you really there at all?  Conor watches the three bullies walking away again.  CONOR  (to Monster w/o turning)  What did the invisible man do?  MONSTER  He called for a monster...  Conor raises his fists. Behind him, the Monster does the  same.  Conor runs after Harry, the Monster following.  ANGLE ON: Harry, Sully and Anton turn in amusement, but their  faces change to fright. Are they seeing the Monster or just  Conor? Sully and Anton bolt, leaving Harry.  ANGLE ON: Conor, runs at him, yelling his rage. He raises a  fist. The Monster raises a fist behind him in mirror. They  both swing forward.  193.",

DAD (CONT’D)  It’s all those old home movies your  mum used to send to me of you when  I moved away. Guess your grandma  got copies, too.  He carefully sets them on the mantelpiece.  ConOR  (shy)  Why did you move away?  Dad sighs.  DAD  You have no idea how young we were,  Con. We had all these dreams, big,  foolish ones that your grandma  didn’t approve of. And then... we  changed.  CONOR  (beat, taking the blame)  Because mum got pregnant with me.  DAD  (comforting)  Hey, hey, hey. You were only ever  good news. Your mum never regretted  having you. I know that for a fact.  (rueful smile)  Because she’s always saying how  much she regretted marrying me.  CONOR  Why did she marry you then?  152.\n\nDAD  My devilish good looks. No, we had  a lot in common. Our lives, our  future. Your mum was amazing. Still  is.   (sighing)  But we grew apart. Your Grandma was  kind of supporting us then and  insisting we be more practical and  I... I was maybe less amazing than  I should have been. We were just so  young. Too young.  CONOR  You didn’t get happily ever after.  DAD  That’s life, though. Most of us  just get messily ever after.  Dad sees Conor’s torn drawing and picks it up, impressed.  Dad (CONT’D)  Even I’m happy you take after her.  (beat)  Shall we go see how things are at  the hospital?  153.

DAD sees the Lawyer out the door, holds up a “one  second” finger to Conor. Closes the door.  Grandma stands as the Lawyer approaches. They clearly have  business together. Conor watches them go. Then he hears  voices arguing within the hospital room.  MuM (o.S.)  (muffled)  Bad show, Callum. Again.  Dad (o.S.)

Grandma looks at Conor, urging him to say something.  ConOR  I’m here, mum.  Eyes still shut, Conor’s Mum reaches out a hand for him to  take. Just like he held it on the cliff face.  There is movement behind Conor, a familiar shadow appearing.  Somehow the Monster fits in the room.  MonSTER  Here is the end of the tale.  ConOR  (to Monster)  What do I do?  The Monster puts two hands on Conor’s shoulders, gently  pushing him towards his mum’s bed.  Conor looks at the clock as he goes. It reads 11.58. Moments  before 12.07.  231.\n\nConOR (CONT’D)  12.07. Is that...?  (whispering)  I’m afraid.  MonSTER  Of course you are afraid. It will  be hard. It will be more than hard.  But you will make it through, Conor  O’Malley.  They reach the bed, where his Mum’s hand is still  outstretched. Conor’s eyes begin to water.  ConOR  (whispering, to Monster)  You’ll stay? You’ll stay until...  MonSTER  I will be right here.  The moment is here. Conor takes his mother’s hand.  She opens her eyes, but she sees him there. Really sees him.  Does she even see the Monster behind him?  Conor can see the light reflected in her eyes, where the  “life” is.  MonSTER (CONT’D)  Now all that is left is for you to  speak the simplest truth of all.  And, at last, Conor can finally tell her the real truth.  ConOR  (simply, quietly)  I don’t want you to go.  Mum  (at the end)  I know, my love. I know.  Conor’s tears begin to spill now, in a quiet way.  ConOR  (again)  I don’t want you to go.  And there’s nothing more to say. He leans forward onto her  bed, and slips an arm around her, holding on to her.  The mother closes her eyes finally. We pull back, Conor holds  his mother, the Monster supporting him, his Grandma across  the bed, holding his Mum’s hand.  DissoLVE TO:  232.",

The music continues over a dream montage of various moments Bella's dreams. Hologram Preble watches all of these off to the side. The dreams are: 1. A clown hands Bella an ice cream cone with 12 scoops and she licks the scoops from bottom to top. 2. Bella sits in a small boat and fishes. Then she's on land holding an enormous fish, twice the size of her. 3. Bella has a bike pump connected a purple character, Fanny, with a round head. She pumps it up until Fanny's head floats away. 4. A furry beast with antlers, The Beast King, is holding a large wasp nest. Bella puts her hand inside the nest. 5. Sitting at a school desk writing math equations on a piece of paper. Bella's tooth falls out and lands on the paper. The tooth suddenly grows in size and has eyeballs and a mouth. It smiles at Bella and picks up the pencil and begins to finish her math work. Bella smiles with a tooth missing. Hologram Preble smiles. INT. - SUGARBABY’S ROOM - NIGHT 18   18  The dream tape ejects. Paper prints out.

PREBLE What are you doing? BELLA I was watching you do your work. You were smiling. 18. Preble is embarrassed. He busies himself with the printout. PREBLE Bella, I hate to be rude but I prefer to do my work in private. BELLA Ah, of course. My apologies. On her way out she hands him a plate with a sandwich on it. BELLA (CONT’D) Some dinner for the tax man. Preble inspects it as Bella stands in the doorway. PREBLE Bella, you need not... BELLA It’s avocado and tomato. You love avocados. She leaves the room.

I’d love to just  kick back with a margarita and  read. Do you mind if I skip the  “King of the World” bit?  JERRY  Well, ugh, it’s not the “King of  the World bit”, that’s Jack and  Fabrizio. This is where Rose says  “I’m flying, Jack”, but whatever, I  can be the only one to do it alone.  Beth looks around in frustration and spots LUCY, a full-  figured cleaning lady watching the attraction fondly.  BETH  What about her?  (to Lucy)  Excuse me, ma’am. Would you like to  take my place in line?  Lucy cautiously approaches.  LUCY  I... I could get in trouble.  BETH  We won’t tell.  Beth removes her hat and places it on Lucy’s head. She steps  out of line and inserts Lucy next to Jerry.  JERRY  Come on, Beth, this is weird.  BETH  Weirder than a grown man standing  on the bow of a fake Titanic by  himself?

BRAD  Check it out. Tammy’s already  drunk. Cool.  Summer tries to close the door, but it’s stopped. She looks  up to see BIRDPERSON, a statuesque hawk-man.

JOE  I mostly got into it because I was  having trouble juggling all the  girls that came pouring my way  after you left. This really helped  organize the barrage.

DANA  You’re an expert now. Guess.  OLLIE  Data...Video...Byte...Tracking?  DANA  Close.  He arrives at the taxi.  DANA (CONT’D)  Doing Very Bad Things.  Dana smiles.

MUZAK plays softly. Families are here, excited.   There is a TOURISM BOARD desk (A SIGN READS, “READY TO MEET AN ALIEN? GO TO SPACE!”).   A LARGE ALIEN CHARACTER, meant to appeal to children, graces the painted board: ”Andy The Alien”.   Two YOUNG CHILDREN get their PHOTOS TAKEN in ill-fitting army spacesuits in front of a powder-blue backdrop. INT.

He looks down at it in  his hands. He hurls it over the edge and heads back down  below.  INT./EXT. STORM PREPARATION  As OUR MAN goes through these preparations he begins to sing  to himself. The song starts out too low to hear, but then  grows.  Loading up potable water from the sink tanks into large  portable water carriers.  Changing the sails to smaller storm sails.  Looking out at the horizon as the front comes closer.  Down below stowing all loose objects away.  Checking the charts/maps to try to place himself.  Going into the bathroom and shaving.  Checking the fiberglass over the repaired spot.  Checking the placement of the life raft and repacking the sea  anchor next to it.  Back up top looking out at the storm. The waves are starting  to pick up.  OUR MAN stops, looks around at his little boat, checking to  see what else needs to be done.  He goes over and checks the auto steering device one more  time. The clouds are now blocking out the sun and it feels as  though night is falling.  INT. BOAT - DARK & STORMY  He is back below prepping his foul weather gear. As he stands  looking at the jacket the boat gets thrown abruptly in one  direction and OUR MAN falls/gets tossed over into the  navigation table.  The charts come down on top of him. He sits on the ground as  the boat begins to get rocked far more violently. He can only  laugh to himself as he knows things are about to get a whole  lot worse.  10. (During a storm like this it cannot be underplayed how loud,  intense, varied, and downright frightening the sounds of the  storm hitting a small boat are. From the waves hitting the  hull, to the wind in the sails and rigging, to the general  pressures put on every element of the ship it is difficult to  explain. The sound design during this sequence will be of the  utmost importance and will play relentlessly through the  storm sequence.)  OUR MAN stands up",

The boat somewhat stabilizes and before it heads down the  next wave OUR MAN goes to the skylight porthole to look up  and sees through the early morning light to see what the hell  just happened.  He rushes over to a side window and sees a few of the stays  (cables that hold up the mast) have ripped from the deck and  are whipping around.  Here comes another massive wave. He braces himself.  It’s not as big but the boat is hurtling down the face and  sounds as though it may start coming apart.  OUR MAN must get out and install the sea anchor.  He forgoes putting on any foul weather gear and goes over to  the steps.  EXT. BOAT - COCKPIT - POV OF DAMAGED DECK - DAWN  As he comes up the steps and into the cockpit the light of  the new day lets him see the size and ferocity of the waves  for the first time. The rain and wind have somewhat died down  but the waves are beyond belief.  Trying not to lock up completely from fear OUR MAN makes his  way to the back of the cockpit, attaches the clip of the sea  anchor to the back of the boat and then, just as he lets the  cloth parachute go into the water, a massive wave builds  behind the boat.  A second smaller cross wave comes and pushes the boat  sideways and it begins a death-roll.  EXT. BOAT - COCKPIT/OCEAN  The cockpit area is now underwater and OUR MAN is doing all  he can to stay attached to the boat. He did not attach the  storm harness this time so he is free floating into the  ocean.  The boat does a massive full flip under the water and then a  noise like nothing else we have heard up to this point. It’s  snapping metal combined with the deep thunder of a fifty foot  wave crashing around him.  14. The boat starts in on a second flip and miraculously he is  scooped back up into the cockpit by total luck as the boat  rights itself in the trough of the wave.  OUR MAN looks around and can’t believe that",

He sweeps and sweeps but doesn't appear to be making progress. He stops the job, frustrated. Just then, there’s a knock on the door. The door begins to open on its own, like in the opening scene, fog spills into the house. The same jovial man wearing a Hawaiian shirt enters holding a can of bug spray. Preble is relieved to see him, as always... BUDDY Whoa buddy! You got a spider problem! Here, try this. Buddy hands Preble the spray can. The label has a picture of a spider with a red X over it. It reads SPIDER SPRAY. BUDDY (CONT'D) This stuff is great! Couple 'o sprays with that and you'll be bug free fo' sure! Haha! Preble holds the can and smiles. BUDDY (CONT'D) Three times more deadly than the other leading brand, you're guaranteed to kill 'em all, haha! Preble begins to spray around his apartment. Buddy is loving it. BUDDY (CONT'D) Oh yeah! Watch 'em squirm, haha! Preble is getting into it, egged on by his friend. BUDDY (CONT'D) Bad day to have 8 legs! Oh yeah, good shot buddy! While Preble continues to spray, there’s another knock on the door. Preble looks up confused. He looks at Buddy. 21. PREBLE Who’s that? BUDDY I’m sure it’s nobody. Another knock. Preble turns to the door… BUDDY (CONT’D) Wait, no. Buddy puts up his hand preventing Preble from going to the door. PREBLE What are you doing? BUDDY If you answer that door, you’re only gonna let in pain. PREBLE What, no. Somebody’s knocking. I should answer it. BUDDY I’ll get it! Preble thinks for a moment and shrugs. Buddy goes to the door, and opens it slightly. BUDDY (CONT’D) We’re not interested, thank you. We can’t see who it is, but it’s a woman’s voice. It sounds like Young Bella. YOUNG BELLA Can I speak with James Preble? BUDDY He’s not accepting visitors at the moment. YOUNG BELLA Well is he here? Preble leans over to see the woman, but she’s being blocked by Buddy. 22.

GRACCHUS  Why on your knees before this  Hebrew, Autolochus?  Baird rises, turning his attention to his friend and placing  a comradely hand on his shoulder.  AUTOLOCHUS  I encountered him before, Gracchus,  beside the well of Jehosaphat. And  what manner of man!  Gracchus doesn’t understand:  GRACCHUS  He is a priest of the Israelites,  despised even by the other priests.

But in his eyes  I saw no shadow of reproach.   I saw  only light.   The light of God.  GRACCHUS  You mean",

Miss Dunne is hanging decorations up, including a disco ball. Darren is moving about with the camera, looking for shots. Across the room, Miss Dunne checks her watch.

More like an American school. And it’s the prom night. We’ll rehearse it. He presses playback, and the band mime. Conor sings into a microphone. But his eyes are on the door. We hear the first verse.

HART’S TOWNHOUSE - LATE IN THE DAY  Fiedler, pretending to run in a ridiculous jogging suit,  trots past the rental car, giving Murphy a furtive glance.

HART’S TOWNHOUSE - NIGHT  A beat as they watch the townhouse. The last glow of ambient  daylight disappears into night.  And then the front door of the townhouse opens. Hart comes  down the steps, still wearing his white hoodie.  Hart climbs inside his Chrysler. He’s visibly nervous. A  stark difference from his usual confidence and calm.  Hart checks the mirror as he pulls out slowly onto the  street. We SEE the Herald’s rental car reflected in the  mirror, pulling out to follow him.  Hart puts on his blinker and deliberately takes a right turn  onto a side street. He checks the mirror again, sees the car  following.  His jaw clenches. His breathing grows shallow.

He’s the only customer in there. Probably the first of the day. He’s looking at jewelry. Rings in particular. He quickly begins to peruse the glass case near the front of the store, and the register. He catches a glimpse of his face in the glass, haggard and worn down and looking much older. The PAWN SHOP OWNER, 50s, approaches from the depths of the shop. PAWN SHOP OWNER Something I can help you find? FORREST Are these all the rings you got? PAWN SHOP OWNER We got some more, some fancier ones. What do you want a ring for? FORREST Oh, for a girl. PAWN SHOP OWNER Well, I coulda guessed that much. What kind of girl do you want a ring for? FORREST The marrying kind, I hope. PAWN SHOP OWNER Oh. Diamond or gold? FORREST ...Gold. PAWN SHOP OWNER Seeing a fella like yourself get hitched gives me hope. FORREST How so? PAWN SHOP OWNER Means I’ve still got time, right? I’ve got something real nice I think you’ll like. Lemme show you... 81. He turns to the back of the shop. He opens a cabinet, behind which is a SAFE. Click click click. The combination falls into place and the safe door opens. Another click. Not from the safe. Cold and all too familiar. FORREST Hold still. The Owner turns around just enough to see FORREST’S GUN, gently pointed at him. FORREST (CONT’D) Now take whatever it was you were going to show me and whatever else you’ve got in there and put ‘em in a bag and hand it over. The pawn shop owner hesitates. FORREST (CONT’D) Go on. The pawn shop owner hesitates some more. His head hung, in disappointment or shame or something like that. FORREST (CONT’D) Go on now. PAWN SHOP OWNER What sort of bag? FORREST Any bag will do. The Owner looks around him, not wanting to make eye contact with Forrest. He finds a brown paper bag and begins pulling things out of the safe. Forrest watches with an eagle eye.

She maternally strokes his hair as he closes his eyes. INT. BRADY’S BEDROOM - NEXT DAY Gold star stickers are carefully applied onto Brady’s chest. Lilly is putting them on him while he sleeps. LOUD KNOCKS. She giggles and quickly scurries out of the room. Brady struggles to open his eyes. INT. BRADY’S TRAILER - DOOR WAY - DAY Brady opens the door, still half asleep, covered in star stickers. MILES, a middle-aged, rough looking landlord and debt collector, with a red face and steely blue eyes, gives him a stern look as he passes. His young song, at most 12 year old, stands behind him with the same annoyed look on his chubby face, clearly emulating his pops. BRADY Hey Miles. What’s goin’ on guys? They pass Brady and walk into the trailer. INT. BRADY’S TRAILER - KITCHEN - DAY Miles struts around the trailer like he owns it - which he does. He checks the light switches. MILES Looking for your dad. Brady wipes his face. BRADY He went to the horse sale yesterday. I haven’t seen him. MILES He owes me quite a bit of money on this trailer. I need payment. 31.

(CONTINUED)\n\nShe locates a little tape player from under her bed, and puts it in, pressing play. SECOND SONG The song begins on acoustic guitar with Conor singing. Raphina smiles as she recognizes his voice. She sits down at her dresser and begins combing her long hair, starting to take off her makeup and kicking off her shoes. The song is instantly catchy, and clearly a love letter from Conor to her. As the song hits the chorus, we PAN off her face, and start a 360 slowly around her room as the song plays over. There’s a family photograph on her locker. A 10 year-old Raphina in the company of her parents. They all look very stiff and awkward. A school profile of Raphina in her uniform, a couple of years ago. Very troubled. Off this to various pictures she ripped out of glamour magazines. Models. Big hair. Lots of make up. A poster of Tom Waits. Of The Cure. Of Siouxsie and the Banshees. There’s a teddy bear on her bed, with a pair of sunglasses on his nose, and an unlit cigarette stuffed into his mouth. An ash tray with a few sticks of incense. A collection of cassette tapes. Cartons of cigarettes. Two books on her locker- Catcher in the Rye and To Kill A Mocking Bird. Numerous magazines. Vogue, You, Cosmopolitan. As the song comes towards its end, we have arrived back around on Raphina. She has transformed. She’s changed into her pyjamas and dressing gown. And she’s taken off her makeup to reveal a bruise, under her eye, and a cut lip underneath. She has paused what she’s doing, and her eyes have filled with tears as she listens to the song. EXT.

We finally see a crack in his demeanor. There’s doubt in his  eyes. He signals the bartender for another round.  FADE TO:  INT. EL CONQUISTADOR MOTEL - NIGHT - LATER  Ernie’s candle sits on top of the TV. The Dodger game is on.  He sits on the end of the bed.   CONNIE MILLS, 56 and white,  paces the room. She’s dressed professionally and wears a gold  ring on her right hand, along with a wedding band on her  left. She’s drinking whiskey and angrily reading a sports  page.  CONNIE  The English language is dead.  ERNIE  No it ain’t.  CONNIE  All the good copy editors are dead.  It’s chaos.   Look ! They mangled half  my sentences and cut like five  graphs from the middle.   None   of  this makes sense.  23.\n\nERNIE  Talk to them, baby.  CONNIE  Bunch of sober twenty-five year  olds. They hate me. They hate my  Joie de vivre. They want me dead.  Ernie sips his whiskey and smiles, enjoying Connie’s rage.  CONNIE (CONT’D)  Don’t you dare laugh. It’s not   your  name on the article.  Ernie puts down his drink and takes Connie’s hands. He  massages them and looks in her eyes. She cools down. Connie  kisses his forehead. She takes off her gold ring and wedding  band and places them on the dresser.  CONNIE (CONT’D)  Well, should we do it? Should we  celebrate our filthy anniversary?  ERNIE  (unbuttoning his shirt)  Come on. Don’t call it that.  CONNIE  How’s your back. Do you need to  stretch first?  ERNIE  No, I’m good.  INT. EL CONQUISTADOR MOTEL - NIGHT - LATER  Ernie and Connie relax in bed. Connie is watching sports  highlights on mute. Ernie reads his Egypt travel guide.  ERNIE  In Alexandria, we’d stay right on  the water. Imagine that. The sun  coming up on the Mediterranean.  CONNIE  Stop torturing yourself.  ERNIE  I can’t help it.  CONNIE  I feel bad. Shouldn’t we go see  him?  24. ERNIE  Larry said no visitors. He wants to  make time with the nurses.  CONNIE  It’s a miracle he’s still alive.  ERNIE  Dude’s immortal. He’s gonna outlive  us all.  CONNIE  You sound disappointed.  ERNIE  I love him, but he’s been promising  to step down for a decade. “Get  ready, Ernie. I’m sending you on  the Grand Tour   next   year.” Next  year never comes. I’m sick of it.  CONNIE  Stop whining. It’s unattractive in  a man.  ERNIE  The place is falling apart.  CONNIE  I heard he’s getting the carpets  cleaned.  ERNIE  Just once in my life I want to be  in charge of something.  CONNIE  Hubris.  ERNIE  Hell yeah! I want my goddamn  portrait on the wall!  Connie laughs. Ernie pulls her close and looks in her eyes.  ERNIE (CONT’D)  A year ago. You walked through that  door...I never thought I’d see you  again.  25. CONNIE  And now, here we are.

He sports a neat, brand new mustache that upon closer inspection is most certainly glued on. He is finishing up painting his fingertips with CLEAR NAIL POLISH. The wipers tick intermittently, letting the wash of rain water accumulate before beating it back and offering a momentarily clear perspective on... ...the BANK across the street, and JOHN HUNT hurrying into it. Forrest puts the cap back on the polish and gives his hand a shake to dry his fingers. He doesn’t seem to be in any particular rush. Next, he presses a HEARING AIDE into his left ear. The wire slips down behind his hair, disappearing into his collar. Then he reaches into the glove compartment and calmly, deliberately takes out a CAREFULLY POLISHED .45. INT. 1ST NATIONS BANK - CONTINUOUS John Hunt closes his umbrella as he enters the bank. He steps up towards the counter. There’s only one teller working behind the glass, and a bit of a line. He takes his place. Behind him, THE BANK DOORS OPEN AGAIN. Forrest enters, a briefcase in hand. He quickly sizes up the place. The line for the teller, the customers and the MANAGER, who is standing in the doorway of his office. Forrest makes a beeline straight for the manager, a diminutive fellow whose name-tag reads ARTHUR OWENS. FORREST Excuse me, sir. I’m looking for the manager... MR. OWENS Well that’d be me. What can I do for you this morning? FORREST I wanted to ask about a loan. Small business. 21.\n\nMR. OWENS Sure, I think we can help you with that. What sort of business are we talking about? Forrest discreetly pulls aside the bottom of his suit jacket and flashes the gun tucked in his waistband. He grins. FORREST This kind. INT. MANAGER’S OFFICE / 1ST NATIONS BANK - CONTINUOUS They step into the manager’s office, which has a big window looking out into the rest of the bank. Forrest takes the liberty of closing the door behind them. FORREST Go ahead, sit down. Mr. Owens does so, and then takes a seat behind his desk. Forrest sits down opposite him setting his briefcase down on the desk. FORREST (CONT’D) How’re you feeling today? MR. OWENS Not so great, since you’re asking. FORREST Well, day’s still young. Mr. Owens sighs and nods. INT. 1ST NATIONS BANK - CONTINUOUS Through the glass doors of the office, Forrest and Mr. Owens can be seen chatting. At one point, Forrest nods in the direction of the bank lobby, and Mr. Owens looks nervously in that direction. A moment later, Mr. Owens leaves the office. Forrest follows him, and loiters outside his door. Mr. Owens approaches the bank’s SECURITY GUARD and gestures to him, muttering for him to follow him behind the counter. Meanwhile, JOHN HUNT advances in line. He checks his watch. 22.",

REVERSE ANGLE: A circle of boys ...seven in a semi-circle, their backs to us, older looking for an elementary, all of them looking down and   in   on one another. All eyes go to Little, a hurried, hushed business. One of the boys breaks away from the circle, hustles over. As he nears, his identity becomes clear: this is Kevin from our earlier “wrestle.” KEVIN Somebody with you? A nod “no” from Little, Kevin moving past him, over to the portable door and “locks” it. Grabs Little’s shoulder strap, pulls him over to the circle. KEVIN I swear it was locked. ...wedges Little...

PORTABLE BOY 1 See! Boy 1 distracted now, looking over at Little. PORTABLE BOY 1 Who let his ass in? KEVIN (O.S.) He just came in. Kevin is over at the door again, playing lookout. PORTABLE BOY 1 What they call you?   Little , right? PORTABLE BOY 1 Show your shit. PORTABLE BOY 3 Why you think they call him Little? Laughs from all the tough guys gathered, Boy 1 grabbing Little roughly by the neck, watching as Little reaches down to himself, nervously unzips his pants. Beat. All the eyes here cast down again, staring down at Little, down at his dick. A curious, prolonged silence, then... KEVIN ...looking back over his shoulder, back at the circle. From his vantage, the backs of all those heads cast down and focused on Little. Off Kevin’s gaze, CUT TO... 23.",

Behind him, the wall is lined with tools:   a  mechanic’s dream enclave.  John enters-  INT. JOHN’S CAR - CONTINUOUS  -and closes the door behind him.  John takes a moment to breath it in:   he loves this car...  although he hasn’t taken very good care of it as of late.

INT. THE HOSPITAL - A HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS  Carrying a humble bouquet of yellow daisies, John slowly  makes his way down the eerily empty corridor. He pauses  before a picture on the wall, glancing at his reflection upon  the glass. He takes a deep breath, exhales, and enters a  room.  INT. THE HOSPITAL - A ROOM - CONTINUOUS  John slowly approaches the figure lying in bed: surrounded by  machinery, accompanied by the soft sounds of technology.  He removes the wilted daisies from the vase, tosses them in  the trash, and replaces them with fresh ones.  He pulls over a chair, reaches out, and takes Norma’s hand:  she is comatose, her breathing synthetic... so many  machines... so many wires, tubes, and monitors.  We never see her face:   just her silhouette.  He holds her hand for a long moment in heavy silence.  3. Behind him, the DOCTOR -of a similar age to John- enters,  placing a hand on John’s shoulder. John lowers his head, and  nods.   With a bit of effort, he stands, staring down at her  for a long moment, never once releasing his grip, and leans  over to kiss her on the forehead.  JOHN  ...it had to be you...  (a long beat, then)  ...be seein’ ya’...  A beat... and John nods.  The doctor turns off the machine; lights dim, the roo",

JOHN’S HOTEL ROOM - CONTINUOUS  A half-eaten meal is scattered upon the table, the bottle of  wine half-empty.  Resting upon the bed, the briefcases lie open, revealing a  veritable armory of dismantled weapons, numerous clips, and  boxes of ammunition.  Sitting at the desk, John pauses from cleaning a pistol to  empty the wine into his glass.   Once done, he pulls back the  slide, studies the pistol with a keen eye, releases it,  carefully loads a clip with bullets, and slides it into the  pistol:   locked and loaded.  From a small wooden case, John selects a SILENCER which he  screws onto the pistol.   He sets it down next to a pump-  action sawed-off SHOTGUN, a SNIPER RIFLE, an old school UZI  SUBMACHINE GUN -silenced- with a polished mahogany stock, a K-  BAR DAGGER, and another pistol.

Closer in. Closer. And then, on Saroo:   Huh. What’s that?  ON GOOGLE EARTH SCREEN: it’s blurry. But it looks a little like a water tower. Saroo blinks, looking at it. Zooming in. His head tilts: - this water tower, getting a little clearer as he zooms.  SAROO’S “MEMORY MAP”: FLASHBACK 1 - WATER TOWER (NIGHT)  Little Saroo alone on the deserted platform. Where’s Guddu? Saroo shivers, holding himself. He looks up. At the tower.  INT. LIVING ROOM, BEACH HOUSE - CONTINUOUS (NIGHT)  Saroo, sitting up straight. Looking as spooked as that child.  96\n\nON SCREEN: it’s a WATER TOWER. It’s certainly similar. Saroo leans in closer to the screen. His finger touches the platform. And the water tower. Working out the angles.  SAROO’S “MEMORY MAP”: FLASHBACK 1 - WATER TOWER (NIGHT)  We PUSH IN on little Saroo, standing frightened on that haunted platform, looking up at the water tower off-screen. REVERSE: we PUSH IN on the water tower.  INT. LIVING ROOM, BEACH HOUSE - CONTINUOUS (NIGHT)  ON SCREEN: zooming, closer, closer. The satellite resolution becoming clearer. That’s a tower. That’s the water tower. The pixels coarsen and blur as the zoom reaches its limit. SAROO  (a breath)  It can’t be - Saroo actually cups his hands over his mouth. His back is ramrod straight. His nerves on fire - - and suddenly, frantically, he scrolls, scrolls, scrolls -  AERIAL - OCHRE FIELDS - DAY  High in the air, we RUSH across the Indian landscape -  INT. LIVING ROOM, BEACH HOUSE - CONTINUOUS (NIGHT)  [NOTE: CONTINUE RAPID INTERWEAVING BETWEEN THE HIGH AERIAL GLIDES & THE GOOGLE SCREEN SCROLLING ...] - ON GOOGLE EARTH SCREEN: as he scrolls, the pointer races across the landscape in jerks: across ochre fields, across rivers, roads ... sometimes the train line is on screen and sometimes not - because Saroo’s not following the track now   -  he   knows   where he’s going - - he’s going HERE: - it’s a DAM. Holy shit. It’s a dam.  SAROO’S “MEMORY MAP”: FLASHBACK 2 - DAM (DAY)  Guddu’s POV: we’re spinning in a circle, holding onto Saroo with outstretched arms as he too shrieks with laughter. WIDE of same: Guddu twirls Saroo around in the shallow water by the dam, tiny Saroo’s feet barely skimming the surface. Guddu lets go, Saroo flies into the water. He jumps up, laughing. Drenched in golden sunlight.  97",

The track becomes a woozy waltz, repeating a ‘down then up’ pattern that goes around and around as the traffic maddens.  The Galant idles in the left hand lane. Baby begins to sweat. Unsure of the neighborhood. The air con blasting. Bats’ cocaine seems to kick in, his restlessness   changing the simpatico of action and music from being magical to menacing . Buddy taps his fingers on a seat rest   in time with the music . Darling flicks through the pages of a magazine,   also in time . Bats cocks and uncocks his shotgun   in time.   Baby eyes this.

Bats does a ‘who me?’ The Cop shakes his head. Then - POINTS at Baby. Motions for him to take off his earphones. Baby does so.   The waltz concludes.   Bat smiles. BATS Yeah Baby. It’s the law.

I thought Matilde does it. She heads down the hallway towards the kitchen. He stops her with a question. WILLY (CONT’D) How was last night? COLETTE It was..interesting. WILLY What happened? COLETTE What do you think happened? WILLY Ah... well don’t tell me. I’ll wait to read about it. When Claudine develops tender feelings towards a lady friend. Colette rolls her eyes.

Colette   sits   quietly   by   as this   chapter   of   their   own   lives   is   read.   But   she   has   more confidence   now   -   more   poise.   She   is   growing   into   herself. He   sets   the   book   down.   A   moment’s   thought. WILLY (CONT’D) It’s   good. COLETTE I   know. WILLY I’d   suggest   you   change   the   line   when Renaud   says,   “It   was   wicked   of   me   to do   it.”   But   I   know   that   you   won’t.

COLETTE Not   behind   her   back,   no.   The   betrayal came   when   Renaud   lied   to   her.   Renaud who   swore   he   would   always   be   honest. WILLY Perhaps   he   wanted   to   tell   her,   but   he was   frightened   of   her   terrible jealousy? COLETTE Then   he   was   a   coward   as   well   as   a liar.

TITLES comes   up,   accompanied   by   ARCHIVAL   PHOTOS   and   MUSIC. TITLE In   1911, Colette’s   “The   Vagabond,”   based on her   music   hall   experience,   was   published under   her   own   name   to   great critical   acclaim. TITLE   (CONT’D) Missy   and   Colette   continued   their   relationship for   many   years.   Missy often   accompanied Colette   on   her   music   hall tours,   though   never again   opted to   appear   on   the   stage. TITLE   (CONT’D) Willy   continued   to   publish   ghost- written books   with   Meg, but failed   to replicate the success of   the Claudines. He   died   in   1931   in   relative   obscurity.  TITLE (CONT’D) Paul Héon did not destroy the original Claudine manuscripts but returned them to Colette. They became crucial evidence in a 1948 legal battle to establish the true authorship of the novels... that Colette won.  COLETTE - FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT   121. TITLE   (CON",

I can give you drills, and check in with you when I can. You want to do that? Adonis nods.

PHILADELPHIA STREET- NIGHT 42   42  Adonis walks down the sidewalk, looking around, questioning if he made the right move coming out to Philly. As he approaches a building, he sees a line of hipsters, mostly black standing outside. Hip- Hop music plays from inside. He keeps walking: not his type of crowd, but as he passes the window, he sees that stops him in his tracks. He looks back at the line, and heads towards it. The camera tracks over to reveal a large flyer with a photo of Bianca on it. INT.

BIANCA This last song, is for anyone who has ever had their heart broken.  26. The HOUSE BAND starts, and Bianca closes her eyes, moving to the beat. She sings, with a beautiful edge to her voice. Adonis watches her closely, she opens them and they seem to catch eyes. INT. PENN CAFE- MOMENTS LATER 44   44  Adonis watching the musicians packing up. We see his POV: Bianca giving the guitarist a hug. She walks over to the bar, and the BARTENDER hands over her purse from behind the counter. ADONIS Wussup, neighbor. Bianca looks up and sees Adonis, recognizing him immediately. She turns back to her purse. Putting the pack of cigarettes back inside. BIANCA Workout boy. I thought that was you. Adonis smiles this off. ADONIS Nice show. BIANCA (disinterested) Thanks. ADONIS Yeah... Can I buy you a drink? BIANCA No. ADONIS Wuss",

Bell creeps her car up closer, watches. Petra is now walking up the street. 66. Halfway down the block, Petra finds another woman, younger, greets her. The woman is also wearing sunglasses and a long coat. A sprinter van approaches, stops. Four men emerge. A startling sight. It takes a second to process. They wear masks. They never stop moving, up steps that lead... toward a bank. As the van pulls away... Petra and the long-coated woman pull masks on, rush behind them... Bell stares at One of the men, long, dark hair flowing behind his mask.  A FLASH  EXT. GANG HOUSE - 17 YEARS AGO - DAY  Silas in the past, glancing back at Petra, his hair the same long hair.

Across the backyard fence, Jay notices movement in the  neighboring yard.  Looking closely, she sees two pairs of eyes peeking out from a  pile of lumber. The NEIGHBOR BOYS spy on her through the chain-  link fence.   A couple dumb little kids - ages 8 and 11.  Jay gives them a dirty look and points.  JAY  I see you.  The boys duck down out of view.  JAY  Don't you have a video game to play or  an animal to torture?  Jay slides deeper into the tub.   She holds her mouth just  above the surface of the water.  INT. JAY'S HOUSE - DAY 5   5  Jay walks inside, wrapped in a towel, her hair wet.  In the adjoining living room, Kelly sits with her friends  watching a bad comedy. They're sprawled across the furniture.  On tv: a man talks with his English-speaking dog about the  woman he loves.   The dog offers bad romantic advice.  PAUL, 17, eats cheese curls on the lounge chair.  YARA, 17, is slumped into the couch cushions with her legs  across the coffee table; a pair or glasses on her nose. She  reads an ebook on her pink-shell-compact smartphone, still  managing to laugh at the television.  Jay stops alongside Kelly and watches a moment of the movie.  Jay smiles and waves to Yara, who glances up just long enough  to see who's around.  JAY  What are you reading?  YARA  The Idiot.  5.  CONTINUED: 4   4  (CONTINUED) JAY  Is it good?  YARA  I don't know yet. It's about Paul.  Paul makes a face toward Yara - irritated.  Jay leans over the couch, letting water drip onto her sister's  face. Kelly swats her away.  PAUL  Hey Jay.  JAY  (smiling at the bunch)  Hey Paul.  MRS. HEIGHT, Jay's mom, drinks wine and smokes in the dining  room - chatting on the telephone.   Laughing.  MRS HEIGHT  (into phone)  Oh no I'd love to.   That sounds fun.  I could come over and cook for you if  you'd like. I make a really delicious  quiche. Do you like quiche?  The woman continues to flirt and smile through the telephone  rece",

It’s Mia and Sebastian’s song.  Mia looks at Sebastian. He looks at her, then back at his keys.  This is the most beautiful we’ve ever heard his playing. The  most tender, and full of emotion, it has ever sounded.  We MOVE CLOSER on Sebastian. We recognize this image. It  recalls the visualization of his dream, back at the RESTAURANT  that night in winter, years ago. Gradually, as Sebastian  plays, his surroundings seem to grow DARKER. Slowly, subtly at  first, with just shifts in lighting, then a shift in  perspective, the interior of the club changes, and soon...  ...we find ourselves back at that same RESTAURANT...   Back when 144   Mia laid eyes on Sebastian for the first time...  Within this fantasy-flashback, Sebastian finishes his piece.  We stick on Mia, watching him as his Boss talks to him. All is  as before, as we remember it... And sure enough, Mia  approaches Sebastian as he walks near her, and --  MIA  I just wanted to say -- I saw your  playing, and I --  -- but instead of brushing past her --  --   Sebastian decks her with a kiss for the ages.  A BURST OF ORCHESTRAL MUSIC. The DINERS in the restaurant spin  around to face Mia and Sebastian -- and SNAP their fingers in  time. Even the Boss starts to DANCE. Mia and Sebastian grin --  and then strut out together, hand in hand...   [EPILOGUE]  INT. NEW APARTMENT - DAY 145  Mia and Sebastian push open a new door -- to their new place.  It’s a shabby one-bedroom -- but it’s theirs...  INT. LIGHTHOUSE CAFE - NIGHT 146  Next, Keith approaches Sebastian at the Lighthouse -- but  Sebastian immediately shakes his head “no”.  INT. THEATER - NIGHT 147  Sebastian watches Mia perform -- it’s the night of her play.  He stands up to applaud -- and behind him, the entire  theater, utterly   packed , rises as well.

It turns again, pulling down a narrow alley, which then widens into an open area partially enclosed by broken factory walls.   The ghosts of old machinery stand rusting and collapsed.   The Jag slows, then stops. Its headlights illuminate a very large corroded metal tank, a rusting metal staircase leading to a platform near its rim. In the surrounding area rusting barrels are tossed here and there, leaking small pools of strangely colored liquid chemicals. EVE (surveying the landscape through the windshield) Delightful. ADAM turns and checks behind him, then switches off the headlights, leaving the engine running. CUT TO: EXT.

ADAM Yeah, sort of, only he was still alive. Suddenly an eerie sound causes them to freeze.   Not far off a group of coyote howl and yip uncannily.  77.

They carry it up the staircase, seemingly without difficulty, indicating prior experience in the physics of moving corpses. Reaching the platform at the top, they pause and peer into the tank, reactively covering their mouths and noses.
